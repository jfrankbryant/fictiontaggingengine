  <p>“Do you want a hug?”</p><p>“No! I almost died just now, didn’t I!”</p><p>“Ah, well, yes. But ‘almost’ really is the operative word here, isn’t it? So come here, you.”</p><p>“I don’t want a hug, Ford.”</p><p>“You never want a hug!”</p><p>“No. So stop asking.”</p><p>“But if I don’t ask, I’ll never know if you change your mind. And you’ll go hugless! Or worse – someone else will get my hug! I reserve your hugs, do you hear me?”</p><p>“I hear you! I hear you! Calm down, would you?”</p><p>“Alright, fine. I’m calm, Arthur.”</p><p>“Right. Good.”</p><p>“… Hey, Arthur?”</p><p>“What now?”</p><p>“Do you want a hug?”</p><p>“Take us home, Ford. Focus on the…. well, driving.”</p><p>“This is a spaceship, we aren’t going to hit anything.”</p>

  <p>“What’s that these guys keep calling you? Eeks?”</p><p>“Ix; it’s a sort of nickname, you see. My father back on Betelgeuse gave it to me.”</p><p>“What’s it mean, then?”</p><p>“Just ‘boy’. He wasn’t a particularly creative man.”</p><p>“I see that. Would you like I call you Ix?”</p><p>“You can call me Im.”</p><p>“Im?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>“If I tell you, you won’t call me it.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“You’re not very affectionate, you know.”</p><p>“What, does it mean ‘friend’ or something? Best bud?”</p><p>“Think… a little more affectionate than that.”</p><p>“Ah, I see.”</p><p>“Your face is red.”</p><p>“Im, huh?”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“Stop it with those big eyes, you idiot. I might call you that. Maybe. Unless Zaphod picks it up.”</p><p>“He knows what it means. He is my semi-cousin brother type thing.”</p><p>“Certainly not, then.”</p><p>“He also knows.”</p><p>“That big mouthed, egotistical president /knows/ knows? God. I need tea.”</p><p>“If it helps, I didn’t tell him. But it’s not like we’re on Earth – no one cares.”</p><p>“I care, Ford. I care. I’m not some homosexual xenophile. And… Ford, let go of me… Ford.”</p><p>“Your planet sure is mean.”</p><p>“Let go.”</p><p>“You’re hugging back, Im.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p>

  <p>“What do you do for fun around here?”</p><p>“I’m doing it right now.”</p><p>“What do the /non/journalists do, then?”</p><p>“I’m not a- Okay. Well, Zaphod watches himself on Tv and Trillian… I don’t actually know what Trillian does.”</p><p>“Tv? That’s- That’s good, actually. Very good. What about that screen in my room; does it get Tv?”</p><p>“Sure. I’ll help you turn it on.”</p><p>“I think I can turn it on myself.”</p><p>“Probably. Hey, wait for me!”</p><p>“You don’t need to- Why are you- Ford… There’s nothing I can say that will stop you from following me, is there.”</p><p>“Not likely, my friend.”</p><p>“I’m drunk.”</p><p>“You don’t drink.”</p><p>“My room’s a mess.”</p><p>“It always is.”</p><p>“I watch bad Tv.”</p><p>“I do too.”</p><p>“You’re persistent. Come in, then.”</p><p>“You weren’t kidding about the messy room.”</p><p>“No. No I was not.”</p><p>“Give me a second to just… and there you are. Pick a channel.”</p><p>“Okay then. Let’s see.”</p><p>“Your concentrating face is cute.”</p><p>“The controls are a bit tricky. I am most certainly /not/ cute. Blimey. I’m a grown man, Im!”</p><p>“Did you just call me…?”</p><p>“No. Absolutely not. Well, a bit. A slip of the tongue, I assure you. It’s nothing. No, not /nothing/. I didn’t mean that, necessarily. I just didn’t say it.”</p><p>“Yes you did.”</p><p>“No I- Let go, Ford. At least loosen up a bit.”</p><p>“You smell nice.”</p><p>“I’m not a sodding scratch and sniff!”</p><p>“I’m not scratching, I’m nuzzling. And was that the hint of a giggle, I heard?”</p><p>“I don’t giggle.”</p><p>“No, of course you don’t.”</p><p>“Quit with that grin of yours.”</p><p>“What grin?”</p><p>“/That/ one.

I’ve properly made up my mind.”</p><p>“What makes you think I’ll let you?”</p><p>“You called me, Im.”</p><p>“Does that mean so much to you?”</p><p>“From you, Yes.”</p>
