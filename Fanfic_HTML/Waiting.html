      <p>They took pride in the accomplishments of their son, and enjoyed his unfailingly cheerful attitude. However, Asher's parents were slower than most in the community to request a second child. They did not do so while Asher was a Three. That was a difficult year, Asher frequently, appropriately chastised, and usually silent.</p>
<p>They were not marked at fault for Asher's difficulty with the required precision of language. Nonetheless, their request took an unusually high number of years to be fulfilled with a newchild. They would of course be assigned a daughter, in due time; two children per family unit was a fundamental rule. Yet they experienced a lengthy wait for her.</p>
