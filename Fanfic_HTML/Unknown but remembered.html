      <p>Lily finds the photograph in the archive within the Annex of the House of the Old.</p><p><i>The colors are all wrong</i>, she thinks as she lifts the tattered sheet from the dusty file, and smiles at the thought.</p><p>Thereâ€™s no reason that she can see for the image to exist at all. The details of the plants are too hazy for it to be a learning aide - besides there's no botanical name given. The file itself has a label, as uninformative as it is precise, tidily written in a firm hand: <i>Place - Elsewhere, Time - Before</i>.</p><p>The Community now has a new definition for Before. There's the slight hesitation, always: "It happened a few years before... Before." Before <em>he</em> left the Community. No one mentions the name, ever, although it hasn't been designated Not-To-Be-Spoken.</p><p>There aren't many decrees from the Elders anymore.</p><p>The edges of the photograph have been worn away from more than time, she realizes, looking closer. Someone once looked at - held - touched this image often. Some<em>one</em> once valued it enough to keep it, keep it safe for a future that didn't - wouldn't - couldn't see the possibilities in the faded colors.</p><p>The unknown and unknowable stories are always the ones that set her mind flickering about, like the fireflies she now dreams of.</p><p>Lily's Assignment may be Historian, her life's task to record the Not-My-Memories. (A lie, not merely imprecise language. They were <em>all</em> their memories now.) But that's not who she is.</p><p>She gently places the photograph aside. On the next Unscheduled Holiday she'll try to write the story of this photograph, and the someone who loved it.</p>
