      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>"You'll be fine, Klaus. I promise that."</p>
<p>Luther's words pulled Klaus out of his haze, glazed eyes making their way lazily to look at his brother.</p>
<p>Luther looked worse for wear, his coat dirty from the scuffle. </p>
<p>Klaus almost felt guilty. </p>
<p>Almost.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello! I hope you are having a great day and thank you for reading! This is a bit of an...internal monologue piece? Sort of. Maybe. It's a lot of Klaus's thought and stuff. </p>
<p>Again, thank you for everything and enjoy!</p></blockquote>

    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>"You'll be fine, Klaus. I promise that."</p>
<p>Luther's words pulled Klaus out of his haze, glazed eyes making their way lazily to look at his brother.</p>
<p>Luther looked worse for wear, his coat dirty from the scuffle. </p>
<p>Klaus almost felt guilty. </p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>But he was Klaus and guilt was a constant emotion. </p>
<p>So it didn't count.</p>
<p>He sat up and spat out a mixture of blood and spit. </p>
<p>"Gross."</p>
<p>"Tell me about it."</p>
<p>"Did you know them?"</p>
<p>That's right, he thought, he'd been beaten.</p>
<p>"Not really. I've seen them before but that's it."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Am I ever sure, Luther?" </p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>A few moments pass and Luther helps him up, choosing to not say anything when Klaus nearly topples over from the pain shooting up his ribs. </p>
<p>"Yep. Yep. Think they're broken." He gasps, eyes watering but not from pain. </p>
<p>His nose is broken too, he can't really feel that one though. </p>
<p>"You wanna go home?"</p>
<p>"Please?" </p>
<p>"Let's go then..." Luther stumbles with him, struggling with the nonexistent weight of Klaus and his wet clothes. </p>
<p>But neither said anything else on the way home, the streets almost empty and angry.</p>
<p>Klaus laughed at this, ignoring the concerned look that Luther was giving him.</p>
<p>Could streets seem angry? </p>
<p>He thought they could.</p>
<p>Angry. </p>
<p>Cold.</p>
<p>Sad.</p>
<p>Luther wouldn't get it if he said it out loud.</p>
<p>And that was okay.</p>
<p>It was always okay.</p>
<p>The two of them stumbled through the doors of the house and successfully avoided anyone who might have been awake. </p>
<p>And no one was. </p>
<p>Small blessings. </p>
<p>He knew the old man would look at the security footage later, but that was a battle for them.</p>
<p>Luther dropped him off in his room, the room draped in tapestries and fairylights. </p>
<p>Old man didn't care what they had in the house as long as it wasn't "interfering."</p>
<p>"Fuck you..." Klaus mumbled laying back gently on his bed, white lightning shooting up his side.</p>
<p>"That's not very nice considering I just saved your ass."</p>
<p>"No. Not you."</p>
<p>"Then who?" </p>
<p>"Who do you think? The living. The dead. The inbetween."</p>
<p>"Klaus?"</p>
<p>"What, Luther?"</p>
<p>"Shut the fuck up." </p>
<p>Klaus stayed quiet and just shook his head, Luther wouldn't get it.</p>
<p>And even as his brother helped him clean up and lightly lectured him on picking fights he couldn't handle, he could not shake that feeling.</p>
<p>The feeling of dying while standing.</p>
<p>The feeling of drowning while trying to swim.</p>
<p>The feeling of how soon, he wouldn't have a home to come back to.</p>
<p>And somehow, </p>
<p>It terrified him.</p>
