      <p>Bailey peels the glove from Poppet’s hand, kisses the inside of her wrist. </p><p>Across the room, his nose in a book, Widget smiles. </p><p>--</p><p>Poppet wraps her arms around his neck. She smells like a summer meadow. Sweetgrass and flowers. He can almost hear birdsong. </p><p>It’s February. In Moscow. </p><p>“I’m so glad you came,” she whispers against his cheek. </p><p>He can feel the weight of Widget’s stare, although he knows he’s nowhere near. </p><p>“I’m glad, too,” he says. </p><p>--</p><p>It mesmerizes him, the first time he walks in on them. He is curiously not shocked at all.</p><p>There is something very real and honest about the way they kiss. Smooth and neat and completely unshy. Frank, shameless, unhesitating. </p><p>Later, it’s the little details he remembers. Not the sight of Poppet and Widget together, but the shadows in Widget’s hair, the kitten playing with one of Bailey’s socks on the floor. </p><p>The way Poppet is still wearing one glove. </p><p>--</p><p>Poppet tips her head back to let Bailey trail kisses down her throat. Her skin is smooth and smells faintly of apples. </p><p>Widget reaches around her and begins unbuttoning her costume. Bailey is careful not to leave marks across her chest and stomach. </p><p>--</p><p>“We want,” she says, and Widget touches him. Lightly, waiting for Bailey to decide. </p><p>But Bailey made this decision years ago, when he first left home. </p><p>Widget's mouth is sharper. He tastes like winter. </p><p>-- </p><p>They like to watch each other, they discover. Poppet and Bailey, Poppet and Widget.</p><p>Bailey and Widget together. </p><p>Poppet likes to watch them quite a bit. Makes them kiss until their mouths are bruised and their throats scraped red with each other’s stubble. Until they’re panting, and clutching too hard. </p><p>Then she lets them have her. </p><p>--</p><p>“I’m so glad you stayed,” Widget says, breathless and gasping. </p><p>Bailey buries a groan against the soft skin of Widget’s hip. Poppet fingers move in teasing patterns across them both. </p><p>“I’m glad, too,” he says. </p><p>--</p>
