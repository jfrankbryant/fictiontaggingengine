  <em>"Incredibly, chance does seem to bend itself to his bizarre mechinations..."</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>"That's his superpower."</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>At first they think he's no threat at all.</p><p>He's born and raised in District One. Born and raised to produce <em>luxury</em>.  He has no need to rebel or uprise: he just goes with the flow and  enjoys a quality of life the rest of the districts didn't even know to  dream about.</p><p>Then his 12-year old son is chosen in the Reaping; a  fluke, of course, that they chose one of the few boys in the entire  district who hasn't lived for the idea of the Games. Who hasn't trained  for the Careers.</p><p>The boy dies on the first day – doesn't even make it out of the Cornucopia.</p><p>Some say <em>he</em> dies at the same time.</p><p>But  if he does die, he's reborn in a silent, invisible flame that only  flickers from his eyes. Something that comes across only in his words,  in conversations with otherwise complete strangers. <em>Doesn't anything seem off about this?</em> and <em>If children are the future, what are we building ourselves?</em>and...</p><p>He's never caught saying anything. The words can never be traced <em>directly </em>back to him. But somehow, they always have that soul-fire flare to them, the one gleaming in his sea-blue stare.</p><p>That's about when they rethink the <em>threat</em> thing.</p>
<hr/><p>Later they think he won't be a threat if they just remove his voice.</p><p>It's  where his thrall over people comes from, isn't it? The silver tongue  and the gold-pressed words, manipulating and cajoling people into  thinking ways they haven't before. Into seeing the tiny little chinks in  their own personal armor; into looking at the screens and seeing  people, <em>children</em>, instead of entertainment.</p><p>Take away his words and the people will stop listening.</p><p>He  doesn't seem surprised when they come for him. Doesn't fight them –  just smiles, something serene and supremely dangerous flickering behind  his dark blue eyes.</p><p>Nothing changes in those eyes when he awakens  after the procedure - muted forever; the flash taken from his gilded  voice - and is put to work in the Capitol.</p><p>But then, nothing  changes in those eyes when he escapes, either, and his silent, wordless  face starts cropping up on video screens everywhere.</p><p>He doesn't <em>have </em>to  say the words anymore – someone else is saying them for him. They come  in writing, codes sent through the television in ways that no one can  trace. They come in fighting, an elegantly brutal violence in the  deepest parts of the Capitol, where no one should be able to go. They  come in subtle hints and sighs to the highest politicians - and in the  missing jewelry of their wives.</p><p>Sometimes words don't <em>need </em>to be spoken.</p><p>Sometimes they just need to be thought.</p>
<hr/><p>Lastly, they finally, <em>finally</em> think that maybe he won't be a threat of they just kill him.</p><p>They  clearly made a mistake for once. The problem is not his tongue. The  problem is his mind. His thoughts, passed on through writing and feeling  and...</p><p>And they realize that they need to find him and the rebels  he runs around with, put them down like rabid Mutts before this  nonsense gets a real chance to spread.</p><p>But somehow, with the advent of feathers and fire, somehow with the rise of the Mockingjay, the odds don't look to good for <em>that</em> either.</p>
