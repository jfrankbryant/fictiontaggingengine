      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In celebration of the world not ending, Newt gives Hermann a blowjob and gets a little more than he bargained for.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>For the following kink meme prompt:</p>
<p>"Newt gives Hermann a blowjob in the lab and Hermann, repressed gentleman that he is, accidentally throat fucks him. Immediately apologizes but Newt really, really enjoys the roughness.</p>
<p>Bonus if Hermann somehow uses his cane to prevent Newt from jerking off."</p>
<p>I...completely missed "in the lab" and I didn't manage to get that bonus, but oh well.</p></blockquote>

<div id="chapters" class="userstuff">
    <h2 class="toc-heading">white burn</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After the Breach is closed, they find themselves far away from the drunken celebrations, locked up safe in Hermann’s room, where Newt is currently kneeling between Hermann’s legs and undoing his belt.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Newton, <em>really,</em>” Hermann says, and god, Newt <em>loves </em>that, that stuffy Victorian decorum even when he’s half-hard, about to get a blowjob. “This is- this is <em>hardly</em>-”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Dude. You want it. I can <em>tell, </em>man, I’m still half in your head, remember?” He tugs Hermann’s cock free from his pants and grins at how it’s already leaking precome. It’s a damn good cock. Newt’s seen, sucked, stroked, and got fucked by plenty of them, and he knows a good cock when he sees one.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Well, maybe he’s a little biased in Hermann’s favor. Oh well.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Newt licks up the length and feels the electric shiver it sends through Hermann, <em>revels</em> in the way he quakes. He smiles and looks up at Hermann, and the way he’s got his lips pursed together, suppressing a groan, <em>Christ</em> it gets Newt even harder. He decides going slow can wait ‘til another day, a day they’re not celebrating <em>saving the fucking world, </em>and he swallows Hermann’s whole cock in one go.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermann gasps immediately and grips Newt’s hair, <em>hell yes, </em>grabs it tight like he’s clinging for dear life, and that makes Newt’s own dick throb with interest. He wraps one hand around the base of Hermann’s erection and uses the other to stroke himself, once, through his jeans. He moans, and the sound sends vibrations up Hermann’s shaft.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermann bucks his hips forward and his cock pushes further into Newt’s mouth- he makes a choking noise, and it <em>burns </em>at the back of his throat-</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermann pulls out instantly, lets go of his hair, and holds Newt’s face in his hands. “Oh, God- Newton, I’m sorry, are you all right? I- I’m sorry, I don’t know what came over me- <em>are </em>you all right?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No- I mean, yeah, yeah, dude, I’m fine. In fact, uh.” He grins sheepishly up at Hermann. “Could you maybe do that again?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I- but that must have <em>hurt, </em>I could never-”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It did! Oh, it totally hurt. But, I...” His cock is <em>straining </em>against the seam of his pants, and he’s so achingly hard he could cry. (Not that he would because <em>please, </em>rock stars so don’t cry. Usually. He’ll check that rule again later, after Hermann’s done totally fucking his mouth.) “I really, <em>really </em>wouldn’t mind you doing it again.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermann looks hesitant. “Are you sure?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>Positive, </em>man. I swear.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“...All right. I. I will.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Newt grins and fills his mouth again, taking as much of Hermann in as he possibly can. He looks up at Hermann and wiggles his eyebrows, trying to silently say <em>go ahead</em>.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Through their connection, he gets a flash of warmth from Hermann, hears a crystal-clear thought, <em>looks so beautiful like this, </em>and his eyes widen with surprise half a second before Hermann thrusts forward again. It <em>hurts, </em>it really does, and he groans and desperately, one-handed, tries to release his own cock from his jeans. He can barely find the zipper, and he gives up and resorts to rubbing himself through the denim.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermann tightens his fingers in Newt’s hair and thrusts again, and the world goes white. His glasses are falling off his face and he can hardly see, but when he looks up, he can just make out the rapturous look on Hermann’s face. Newt moans and <em>fuck, </em>Hermann just made him come in his jeans like a teenager.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Newton,” Hermann says, sounding strangled. “Newton- Newt, I’m about to-”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He gives him a hasty thumbs up and teases at Hermann’s cock with his tongue. Hermann comes down his throat in a searing burn, and Newt does his best not to make a choking noise, because he <em>knows </em>Hermann will get all concerned and embarrassed and he’ll never let Newt do this again.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Which would be a goddamn <em>tragedy, </em>honest to god.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermann pulls out of his mouth and loosens his grip on his hair, and instead of tugging it, he starts petting it, so softly and gently. “Are you all right? Was that- was that fine?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Dude,” Newt laughs, and his voice is hoarse (<em>Hermann </em>did that, his stuffy, stick-up-his-ass Hermann, how <em>awesome</em>). “I should be asking you that.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermann’s cheeks go pink. “It was- it was very good. Truly. Now, I could, ah, return the favor-?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Newt giggles, giddy. “Nah, man. Not, uh, not necessary. Maybe I’ll take you up on that next time.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Next time,” Hermann repeats, like he’s astounded such a thing could exist. “Quite.”</span>
