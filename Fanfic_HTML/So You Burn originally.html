    <h1>So You Burn (originally entitled, "Strip and Burn")</h1>
    <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="http://archiveofourown.org/users/iliveinfantasies/pseuds/iliveinfantasies">iliveinfantasies</a></div>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Johanna Mason is a bad-ass bitch, and certainly not the sort to dwell on something as stupid as the face Katniss made in the elevator. Or maybe Johanna's self-loathing has something else to say about that.</p><p>Takes place during Catching Fire, just after the elevator scene. It's my take on what Johanna feels after stripping in the elevator. Might turn into a longer work.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Again, takes place during Catching Fire, the elevator scene.</p><p>Warnings: swearing, because Johanna. Lots of swearing. Might turn into a longer piece.</p><p>As always, please let me know what you think, if you are so inclined!</p><p>ALSO, for those waiting for chapter 2 of "I'm Johanna," I am working on it!</p></blockquote>

    <h2 class="toc-heading">So You Burn (originally entitled, "Strip and Burn")</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thanks. Let’s do it again sometime.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">You exit the elevator <em>with purpose</em>, feel the door whoosh shut behind you, your fake-of-course-its-fake-everythings-fucking-fake-in-the-capitol hair brush lightly against your back. It feels like Capitol plastic, all synthetic-fibers and freshly-grown-fear, and it’s making your whole body tingle in a way that makes you want to throw the hair into the ceiling fan. You slow the tread of your bare feet against coarse carpet and close your eyes for a moment, and chuckling very lightly. Self-satisfaction ebbs slowly throughout your whole body as you recall the look you just left in the elevator, the <em>whattheactualfuck</em> look that overcame Katniss’ face when you took your clothes off (<em>imeanthatsnodifferentthanusualRIGHTgirlno)</em>, and the tiny tingles turn into full-on jolts in your belly as the red-of-her-cheeks registers behind your eyelids–</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Fucking STOP, Johanna. The FUCK.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You open your eyes and narrow your eyelids, somewhere between really-fucking-irritated and actually livid, and it’s making your throat hurt. You draw air quickly through your teeth and choke just a little, not realizing you’re gritting your teeth. You feel a jolt of pain pierce your side, forgetting again about the poorly-healed-breaks-in-your-once-cracked ribs(<em>ohgodohgodpleasedontnotagain) –inhale–</em> and how much it hurts to breathe deeply. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But you could give less of a fuck about that right now.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Exhaustion overcomes you now, all the self-satisfied splendor leaving your body in a<em>whoosh (like a bellows like–) </em>and you slump against the wall. Your skin itches again, and you shift slightly, absolutely fucking loathing the way the ugly hallway wallpaper feels rubbing against your bare back, but you really can’t motivate yourself enough to move. You press your face into your hands and realize you’re shaking, just a little, full of a fire-fury you didn’t even realize you were capable of anymore. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>It always was ironic, really, feeling fire-fury as a wooden girl. But then, you always knew you were meant to self destruct someday, burn yourself to oblivion. </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">You narrow your eyes and grit your teeth harder, move your lips justalittle, shape-shifting them from grimace-to-snarl. You bite deep into the just-chapped skin of your painted lips, reveling in the feeling of sharp-bone cutting into fleshy skin. Here you are, naked, pressed against the wall in the middle of the hallway on the seventh floor of the Tribute building, and all you can think of is Katniss-<em>fucking</em>-Everdeen, and the color of her cheeks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You don’t even understand it. She’s the most pathetic fucking thing you’ve ever seen in your life, all prettyface to Peeta’s prettywords, stumbling over sentences, choking on clauses and trying to smile!pretty for the cameras like the rest of the<em>ohsofuckingdeadheyheyanotherfucktonight</em> dead-eyed tribute Winners! She’s the worst goddamn actor you’ve ever seen. She’s self-centered in too many ways and self-righteous in others and so utterly fucking <em>brainless</em>, and you can tell can (see it in her face whenever she peeks out Capitol windows to the not-world you live in) that she’s been fucking <em>numb</em> to life since childhood.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Except she <em>isn’t </em>pretty, not to you.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She’s beyond fucking <em>lovely.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And you really fucking hate it.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Because of all the filling-un-fucking-fulfilling parts of your miserable <em>fucking</em> life, it’s <em>her, </em>this <em>little lost puppy child</em> who has made you the warmest you’ve been in fucking <em>years.</em> Maybe your whole goddamn miserable life.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">And she doesn’t even know, doesn’t even fucking realize. She’ll never be able to see, and if you have anything to say about it, will never spend enough time with you in the arena to figure it out (<em>Not that she could the girl is as bright as a bag of nails but who are you fucking kidding you wont actually be able to stay away.)</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Except.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Except.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">No matter how much she loathes it, what a miserable fucking excuse for a rebellion figurehead the girl is. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She’ll always start the slow burn in most fucking wonderfulfuckingpainful way you’ve ever felt; always ignite your body, cause your blood to fucking boil in your veins your chest the lights behind your eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Because maybe you’re Johanna <em>fucking</em> Mason, and you might be made of wood-beyond-petrified-into-stone,</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But she’s the girl on fucking <em>fire.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>And she’ll always make you burn.</em>
  </span>
