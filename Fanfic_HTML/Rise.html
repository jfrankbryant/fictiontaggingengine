    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Magic.</p><p>What he had, inside, sometimes he could call it magic.</p><p>It was plain, but it was his, and it was always contraband. From the coins in his palm to the feelings he got about things, to who he was. He didn't say anything. He couldn't say anything.</p><p>And so he put them away. Used them when it was necessary, but put them away, in a part of his mind no one had ever gotten to.</p><p>Do your own time. Not anybody else's.</p><p>That's what he told himself when he'd put them in their thought-box.</p><p>He believed what he could see in a tangible way, his own eyes, his own mind that wouldn't play tricks on him.</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>He chuckles a little bit, laughter of the damned, about how to deal with airport employees.</p><p>Slip the chains and don't look back. Don't look back.</p><p>Except maybe at Low-Key, sometimes, you know, a man he'd known well.</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>He feels it in his gut, how somehow, some way, this Mr. Wednesday is asking him to do his time.</p><p>He feels it and he feels something erode or rust a little and maybe he drops part of his prison-life ethos for just long enough to catch--</p><p>--whatever this is, whatever is about to happen to him.</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>He goes willingly to the tree, and that's important to remember. He understands things now, and Odin, he knows who Odin is, and he goes to the tree (for knowledge) in service.</p><p>Not knowing if he will survive.</p><p>Not sure if he cares--he's always been bad about that, it's been bred into him and beaten into him a little--but he'll see.</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>And then there is survival. </p><p>Survival at the very last.</p><p>And he rises.</p>
