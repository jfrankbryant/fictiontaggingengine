    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <em> when i was a child, i heard voices </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> breathe </em>
</p>
<p>He can’t see anything beyond the <em> red, red, red </em> light behind his eyelids. He can’t hear anything but the overpowering screams and voices in his head. Disconnected from actuality, he can’t feel the ground beneath his feet and his skin feels too heavy on his bones.</p>
<p>
  <em> breathe </em>
</p>
<p>(If he were more present, he’d have noticed the reason he couldn’t feel the ground was because he was <em> fucking floating above it </em>)</p>
<p>
  <em> some would sing and some would scream </em>
</p>
<p>Echoes of past lives reverberate through his being like they’re settling in his soul, clawing at every part they can reach. It’s a chess match, their evil battling against what’s left of his kindness. </p>
<p>Being possessed by the ghosts had never felt like this; the past few months, a few had slipped beyond his barricades and took control, but he always managed to push them out.</p>
<p>Now though, now he had no control.</p>
<p>He was <em> pissed off </em> damnit. A part of him didn’t <em> want </em> control. He wanted to snap, let the ghosts do whatever the <em> fuck </em> they wanted with this body. They fed on that part, swarming him and floating in and out of his body like he owed it to them. </p>
<p>He was sick of being treated like he was impotent- more so a liability. He was sick of his siblings looking down on him even though he’d proven himself to them time and time again. He was sick of pain, sick of <em> constant fucking pain. </em> </p>
<p>
  <em> breathe </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Klaus, you’re the lookout.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Klaus, get sober.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Get your act together.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Scrawny little junkie”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> You soon find you have few choices </em>
</p>
<p><em>I learned the voices died with me </em> </p>
<p>At a young age, if the ghosts got too close to him, he’d feel trapped. He’d feel like he was being <em> infected </em> by their pains, swirling around his head like smoke. He remembers clawing at his skin for hours on end, wanting- <em> needing </em> to tear away the way they made him feel. </p>
<p>He remembers dying. </p>
<p>Remembers the sudden peace. </p>
<p>Remembers how quickly it was torn away.</p>
<p>Right now, peace seems unattainable. He almost welcomes the feeling- the feeling he’d pushed away for decades. </p>
<p>He welcomes the feeling, because it was the first thing he’d really <em> felt </em> but pain since February 23rd 1963. </p>
<p>
  <em> i’d sit for hours<br/>
staring into open flame<br/>
something in it had power<br/>
could barely tear my eyes away.</em>
</p>
<p>It <em> burned</em>, so satisfyingly burned. The ghosts swarmed and far away- so far away, he could hear his siblings yelling. </p>
<p>
  <em> calm down, Klaus.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>breathe, Klaus </em>
</p>
<p>
  A voice- a voice so achingly reminiscent of sweltering nights in Vietnam told him to breathe. He pushed it away.
</p>
<p>
  <em>It burned, burned like the fiery pits of hell.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Anger. Fury.</em>
</p>
<p>

    <em> Power. </em>
  </p>
<p>
  Power, yes.
</p>
<p>
  Never in his life had he felt such power. His father told him he had potential to unlock and- 
</p>
<p>
  <em> oh reggie, if only you could see your </em> greatest disappointment <em> right now </em>
</p>
<p>
  Things were smashing all around him. He couldn’t bring himself to wonder<em> why.</em>
</p>
<p>
  He was floating, now, so far away from his own body. It felt like when Ben possessed him, but so much <em> more. </em> 
</p>
<p>
  He wondered, briefly, if the ghosts were possessing him, why weren’t they fucking doing <em> anything. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>(later, he realised it’s because there were so fucking many. they couldn’t take control when there were so many competing for the vessel that was Klaus Hargreeves.) </em>
</p>
<p><em>(he was too stubborn to acknowledge that maybe- </em> maybe <em> he didn't  want his siblings to be hurt by an army of the dead in power through his body- did he? It did satisfy him to scare them, though. Maybe now they’d stop underestimating him.) </em></p>
<p>
  <em> don’t you ever tame your demons</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>but always keep them on a leash. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> harness your power, Number Four. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> godamnit, breathe, Klaus. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>tap into your potential.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You have to learn to control them, Four.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Breathe. Come on Klaus.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Fucking shit, Klaus. Stop smashing shit! </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Unhelpful, Luther! </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Breathe, baby. You can do it. Just breathe. I love you. Breathe. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Number Four.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Klaus, my love.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Number Four.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Scrawny little junkie. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Number Four</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>My love.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I love you. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> I knew that something would always rule me</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Don’t you ever tame your demons, but always keep them on a leash.</em>
