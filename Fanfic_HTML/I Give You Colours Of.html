      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I just found it so annoying that at the end of the book... there was no mention of what happened to Jonas or Gabe... and I kinda just wanted to write my own alternate ending!</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I have just finished reading the Giver... but I remember watching the film when I was little. And I just wanted to give another ending!</p>
<p>I have just finished the first book, and have just started the second!</p></blockquote>

    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>It was freezing! Gabe was crying, and to be honest I think I was crying too. It was so long! It felt like my legs has been stripped of my blue-tinted skin, my ankle was on fire, throbbing! Burning!</p>
<p>Gabe’s whines just went right through my brain.</p>
<p>‘We are so close, so close Gabe.... please... hold on.’</p>
<p>I wrapped the delicate child in my tunic and then pulled the ratty blanket over my shoulders. </p>
<p>I started to think of that memory... the one the Giver gave me... the one with the fire... and grandparents... the warm crackling fire place... the one of love.</p>
<p>Slowly our bodies warmed up... the memory was starting to dim in my brain, but blossomed in Gabe’s.</p>
<p>I pedalled harder on my father’s bike, we were close! So close! I could taste it!</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>It was close... I said forever long ago!</p>
<p>My reality was dimming, I was giving all of these wonderful memories to Gabe. Never the ones of hurt, pain or fear... he had faced enough of it himself!</p>
<p>All the memories of sun! Of light! SNOW!</p>
<p>GRANDPARENTS!</p>
<p>RAINBOWS AND ALL THE EXISTING COLOURS!!!</p>
<p>My coloured world was now turning into the black and white grayscale existence, that I had known for a long time. I found it quite comforting really! Going back to what I know....</p>
<p>As it felt like I was going to end... I saw a town!</p>
<p>At first I thourght my eyes were tricking me.</p>
<p>But Gabe saw it too!</p>
<p>I pedalled so hard I am amazed that my father’s bike did not catch fire!</p>
<p>I PEDALLED AND PEDALLED!!!</p>
<p>It felt like the town was just getting further and further. But I kept going as it was there!</p>
<p>.......</p>
<p>How long?<br/>How long have I been pedalling!</p>
<p>I just fell... fell of the bike.</p>
<p>I just cried in my arms.</p>
<p>I was so stupid! So childish! I have made Gabe’s life worse! If he was released he would have never had to experience any of this!</p>
<p>WHY WHY WHY</p>
<p>I took Gabe in my arms! Tears running down my cheeks!</p>
<p>‘Now I give you the last colour my dear Gabe... the colour blue! The colour of yours and my eyes! One of the prettiest colours! The colour of sea, oceans and skies.’</p>
<p>‘I give you the colours of dreams, my dear Gabe! And make sure to share it...’</p>
<p>I knew someone was coming, that’s why I gave him my last gift of colour.</p>
<p>I felt someone take Gabe out of my arms, and I let them. They could give him a better life than I could.</p>
<p>‘Sir, Sir!’<br/>I looked up.<br/>‘What is your name? Why do you have such a child? Your could be no more than eighteen years old!’<br/>‘My name is Jonas. I was the Reciver in training... but now one of two Givers. I stole the child because he had potential and they were going to kill him!’<br/>That was kind of a lie...<br/>‘I did not want to see such talent die. So I stole him. So he too could experience some of the amazing things I have!’</p>
<p>This man just looked at me, with such a small child, Gabe, in his arms.</p>
<p>‘Please take care of him. Tell him when he grows up that he is the reason he can see the things other can’t! Tell him, tell him... that I am Jonas. Died as Twelve-nineteen.’</p>
<p>I got up and started to walk into the snowstorm.</p>
<p>And let the wrath of the winds drown me in snow...</p>
