      <p>The glitter was Klaus’s least favorite part of getting ready for work. It got everywhere and on everything. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He still even had some left in his hair from last night.</p>
<p>But his profession deemed it necessary. </p>
<p>Ben sat on his bed, looking annoyed at his brother.</p>
<p>“You look ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“No. I look good.” He replied, patting his eyelid with some gold glitter and blinking quickly. </p>
<p>“No. You look strung out.”</p>
<p>And he did. He looked horrible with this sunken cheeks and hollow eyes that screamed of that scared kid still. It gave him a look of innocence, and it got him clients.</p>
<p>“And you look dead. What’s the point here?” He snapped back, half joking.</p>
<p>“Ouch. Insulted by the stripper.”</p>
<p>“Ouch. Insulted by the dead.” </p>
<p>Ben laughed at him, this banter was a part of their nightly routine. It didn’t make it any easier for him, knowing that he couldn’t do anything to help Klaus. </p>
<p>He hated how his brother was pissing away his life away with the cocaine and yknow, taking his clothes off for strangers in an attempt to get a few bucks. </p>
<p>But he didn’t bring it up. </p>
<p>He knew why Klaus was like this. He knew why every single one of his siblings were the way they had turned out.</p>
<p>And also why he had ended up dead.</p>
<p>Klaus was in the closet now, looking through hangers and outfits. </p>
<p>“This?”</p>
<p>He held out a simple schoolgirl outfit, one that would obviously be too small for him.</p>
<p>“Not much to the imagination.” </p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>A few minutes pass.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This?” </p>
<p>He held out a pair of simple ripped jeans and an old band shirt that would be too big on him. Ben recognized the shirt as Diego’s. </p>
<p>It sent a flare of anger through his chest.</p>
<p>“Yeah. That one.” </p>
<p>“Cool. Cool. I’ll just uh, get changed then.” </p>
<p>“Whatever.” </p>
<p>Moments passed and Ben got up and walked around the bedroom.</p>
<p>“I’m already tired, Ben.” Klaus mumbled, throwing on his jacket and scarf. </p>
<p>“You’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“I know… That’s why I have you.” He laughed, shaking his head as he left.</p>
<p>“I’ll be home at sunrise. Keep safe, I know it isn’t hard.” The taller man closed the door behind, leaving Ben in silence.</p>
<p>He looked at the clock, it was early.</p>
<p>He knew his brother was going in search of a fix.</p>
<p>But what could he do?</p>
<p>He was powerless but also, the one in control.</p>
<p>“God, I’m Jiminy Fucking Cricket.” </p>
<p>Waffles were waiting and he had the house to himself, he would wait until sunrise.</p>
