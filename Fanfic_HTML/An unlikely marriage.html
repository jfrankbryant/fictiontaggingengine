      <p>
  <span>Bitterblue  tries hard not to gloat, but she can't help feeling slightly  vindicated. Five years after reforming the government, she accepts  Skye's marriage offer. What does surprise her is that it was Skye's  idea.</span>
  <br/><br/><span>He  is lounging in her rooms, having just returned from the Dells, full of  stories and drawings of all he has seen in the eighteen months since he  last visited. With him are letters from Fire, and King Nash, and Hanna,  but they can wait for the joy of his presence. Bitterblue is less lonely  than she had been when she was younger, but having a visitor is always  lovely.</span>
  <br/><br/><span>"Has it been more marriage talk, then?"</span>
  <br/><br/><span>She  snorts. "Always and forever. 'You must produce an heir, Lady Queen,  before your insides shrivel up and fall out.' I'm twenty three. I surely  have some time."</span>
  <br/><br/><span>"And you've considered no one?"</span>
  <br/><br/><span>"None that would make a good match, no."</span>
  <br/><br/><span>"What about </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span>?"</span>
  <br/><br/><span>Her first reaction is to laugh. He scowls.</span>
  <br/><br/><span>"Oh, Skye, don't."</span>
  <br/><br/><span>"No, I'm serious."</span>
  <br/><br/><span>She  looks at him then, steady and appraising. Skye is in his early  thirties, handsome, and unquestionably prefers men. She has watched him  kiss and flirt with plenty of them to be quite sure, even if he hadn't  explicitly told everyone when she was still a teenager. He has become  her close ally and friend, working with both the Council and herself to  ensure Monsea and the other kingdoms make steady work towards better  lives for their citizens. His regular travels to and from the Dells have  brought science and medicine far forward of where they had been, and  his ideas about representative governments have slid into the uprisings  in other kingdoms. Bitterblue had adopted them openly, gladly. They are  good ideas.</span>
  <br/><br/><span>When  she finally speaks, it is quietly. "You prefer men, though. I would  want more than just a political marriage, as much as I do love you."</span>
  <br/><br/><span>He  has clearly considered this, leaning forward so his elbows are on his  knees. It makes him less overwhelmingly tall, more human-sized. "Well.  Yes. But I wouldn't begrudge you any other relationships if you would do  the same for me. I've...someone...I would be happy to also stay with.  But as the Queen, your marriage is inherently political. Better to marry  someone who already loves and respects you and your work, surely?"</span>
  <br/><br/><span>She  considers this. He's right, that marrying someone she knows is the only  real answer. She could not trust a partner from outside the Council,  though there is also the possibility of one of the royals from the  Dells. Nash has only granddaughters, which doesn't solve the problem any  better. The one person she liked enough to kiss has not come home since  he left.</span>
  <br/><br/><span>"We  would need to work out an appropriate system of how to keep these  lovers without it being an enormous mess. And also find me one. I'm sort  of lacking in the department."</span>
  <br/><br/><span>There is a knock at the door, then. Irritated, Bitterblue shouts, "What? Come in."</span>
  <br/><br/><span>It  is the gold that catches her first. Gold in ears and on the hands  opening, then closing the door quietly. His skin has darkened with being  at sea, his hair gone very close to white. His eyes at the same, and he  looks at her, unsure of his welcome.</span>
  <br/><br/><span>Skye coughs. "Yes. About that. I have a mutually beneficial solution in mind."</span>
  <br/><br/><span>Somewhere  under her laughter, muffled into Saf's chest as he holds her close, and  then closer when Skye wraps his arms around them both, Bitterblue is  working out his implications. She can only kiss them both when the look  the two men share makes it all plain.</span>
  <br/><br/><span>She pokes Saf in the chest. "You are going to stay put this time."</span>
  <br/><br/><span>"I think I'm finally anchored enough to try."</span>
