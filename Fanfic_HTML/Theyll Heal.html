    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>My lips used to ache all the time.  They used to be chapped and cracked and bleeding from the chill in District 12’s air.  I sucked them in my mouth and gnawed on them when the memories were just a little too painful. </p>
<p>    It was just another way to cope and exponentially less destructive than drinking my liver to ruin like Haymitch does.  Which I still do, when I have my moments of it all being to much and the memories come flashing in my eyes like a flurry of arrows.  But I don’t drink often. </p>
<p>    I’m with her now.  Johanna.  She gives me reasons not to drink, not to hurt myself.  And I do the same for her.  Occasionally, I bite my lips and spend my days in bed, hating how in each window pane I can see their faces:  All of them.  Playing their deaths over and over again like a television special the Capitol put on to celebrate their victors.</p>
<p>    But at least Johanna’s there with her limbs wrapped around me like chains, keeping me from doing anything stupid like killing myself.  She tells me it would be stupid anyway.</p>
<p>    Who would be here to keep me from killing them all?</p>
<p>    She asks me this when I feel like I need to die, and I can’t argue with her logic because I’m the only who can contain Johanna Mason.</p>
<p>    My lips, they ache, but Johanna encases them with hers and I know:</p>
<p>    They’ll Heal.</p>
