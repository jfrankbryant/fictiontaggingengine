    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>The coat was elegant. It was beautiful. It had an imposing collar, a slit up the back, a myriad of pockets, and- more than any of those other things- it had <em>style. </em>The boy had known it from the first moment he’d seen it, crammed among other, lesser goods in an unassuming market stall.</p><p>He wouldn't say the coat was meant to be his- that would imply destiny. The boy was half certain that there was no such thing, and wholly certain that if there were, he wanted nothing to do with it. But he would say that <em>he </em>meant for that coat to be his, and that was that. </p><p>He’d inquired about the coat’s price, carefully careless. As if this was a matter of no importance, a passing curiosity. As if he didn’t see his future here, all wrapped up in leather the color of a wet street at midnight. </p><p>“Nothing you can afford, kid,” the vendor had informed the boy roughly. The boy did not like being called <em>kid. </em>He had not yet mastered the art of making other people see him the way he wished to be seen- once he had, he would be <em>mister, </em>perhaps, or perhaps even <em>sir, </em>or maybe <em>you bastard, </em>but never again <em>kid. </em>Until then, though, people called him what they called him, and he gritted his teeth as if one of them might be cyanide this time. He spat on the tile between the vendor’s splayed feet, and continued to look at the coat anyways.</p><p>He pawed at the hems, checking for frayed edges. (There were none.) He ran his fingers over the seams and the lining, checking for pockets. (There were many.) He lifted the whole affair up by its shoulders, checking if it would fit him. (It wouldn’t, not yet.) Nothing he saw about the coat did anything to dispel his first impression of it- that it was elegant, it was beautiful, and it <em>would </em>be his.</p><p>“It’s a fine enough piece,” the boy said, bending his mouth around the understatement. “I’ll give you the ending of a story no one else’s ever heard for it.”</p><p>The vendor scoffed. “What, no one?”</p><p>“Excepting the author, I, and- if you take the offer- your fine self.”</p><p>The vendor scratched their chin, speculative. “What story? Not the one with the tiger in it?”</p><p>“The one and same.”</p><p>“No good. I don’t care for the bloody tiger or any story it’s gotten into. Anything else, kid?”</p><p>“A name, then,” The boy offered, too quickly. He bit his tongue, tried to gather himself, to sound like the kind of person who could be bartering for this coat. “I’ll trade you the name my own father gave me.”</p><p>“And what’d I want that for?”</p><p>“I don’t expect that’s any of my business.” </p><p>“Hmph. Keep it.”</p><p>The boy looked at the coat again. No one, he thought, no one would call anyone wearing a coat like that <em>kid. </em>He looked at the coat, and he looked at his own hands, and he looked at the vendor and he looked at the vendor’s teeth, half bared in a vague attempt at a salesperson smile. It did not reassure.</p><p>“A pound of flesh,” he said, and was gratified not to hear his own voice break.</p><p>“A what?”</p><p>“A pound of flesh. For the coat.”</p><p>There was a pause, and the boy tried a smile. The smile would have liked to have been easy and enormous, a glittering anchor stitched into the dullness of the world, but the boy hadn’t quite gotten the hang of it yet.</p><p>“Two.”</p><p>Hands were shaken. A short while and a quick journey to the butcher’s later, the boy left the market with haste and a new coat. It had an imposing collar and a slit up the back. It was the color of a wet street at midnight, and it was entirely too large for the boy now wearing it. He’d grow into it in time, and in the same way, he’d grow into his smile, and out of anyone ever calling him <em>kid. </em>But as for what he’d be called next... <em>mister </em>and <em>sir </em>were unambitious in retrospect, and <em>you bastard </em>might do in a pinch, but was hardly a way to introduce yourself. No, he thought, as he left the hubbub of the market far behind, the hem of his coat brushing the filthy ground as he walked, trying out new steps, new poise. No, none of those names would do.</p><p>But he rather liked the sound of <em>marquis.</em></p>
