  <p>Alighting from a broomstick in the courtyard of Hogwarts, to Minerva’s utter surprise, were Ada and Hecate.</p><p>“What on earth are you doing here?” Minerva said, peering over her spectacles and pursing her lips.</p><p>Hecate cleared her throat. “We thought we ought to visit.”</p><p>“—Since it’s your birthday,” Ada finished.</p><p>Ada rushed forward to embrace Minerva tightly, nearly bowling her over with enthusiasm, while Hecate gave Minerva a wry smile. She approached, leaning in over Ada, and kissed her.</p><p>“You’re spoiling me,” Minerva protested, as Ada revealed a basket of presents and their cuddling familiars.</p><p>“You deserve it,” Hecate asserted.</p>

  <p>“You know, I’m still not letting you off so easily,” Julie sighed. “My Millie was sent to prison. And for what? She was innocent.”</p>
<p>“Oh— Julie—” Dimity gave her a pleading look. “I have three words that I think will cheer you up.” Dimity twisted her mouth cheekily, picking up an envelope. “I have tickets.”</p>
<p>Julie gasped. “You didn’t! Dimity, I told you those tickets were way too expensive!”</p>
<p>“What do you think they pay me in? Pondweed? Am I out of the dog house?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. You can even sleep in the bed with me if you like,” Julie winked.</p>

  <p>Dimity could not help but lose herself in a glance cast idly across the hall by one Arabella Hempnettle. They were at the Magical Sports Symposium, and it was the first time Dimity had seen her since the worming.</p>
<p>She hesitantly approached Arabella during the break.</p>
<p>“How’re you doing?”</p>
<p>Arabella forced a smile. “I’ve been better, Dimity.”</p>
<p>She started moving away, but Dimity stopped her with a soft hand. “Bella, I—”</p>
<p>“I wish I could undo the things I did, Dimity, but I can’t. I can never make it right.”</p>
<p>Arabella shrugged Dimity off and walked away, leaving Dimity hollow.</p>

  <p>“Hecate, wait here—”</p>
<p>Hecate blinked. “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be back before you know it.” Jennifer pressed a kiss to her cheek, leaving her looking out over the lake.</p>
<p>The Lake District was a welcome break from their summer of revising lesson plans for the coming year. Hecate admitted it was rather pretty.</p>
<p>Soon enough, Hecate heard the crunch of pebbles behind her, and Jennifer returned with two ice cream cones.</p>
<p>Hecate gratefully accepted, and hesitated before giving hers a self-conscious lick.</p>
<p>“You— you’ve got some on your nose.” Jennifer ran her finger down Hecate’s nose, and Hecate blushed.</p>

  <p>“You always play with mine. I think it is time that I return the favour.”</p>
<p>That was how Jennifer ended up sitting at Hecate’s dressing table, while her hair flowed from Hecate’s long black nails.</p>
<p>“But you have such long hair, and mine is shorter so it can’t be much fun to play with,” Jennifer protested.</p>
<p>Hecate looked Jennifer in the eye through the mirror. “I believe that is for me to decide.”</p>
<p>She drew Jennifer’s hair into a smooth honey twist, pinning it up from her neck.</p>
<p>“Now I can do this,” Hecate purred, and kissed behind Jennifer’s ear.</p>
