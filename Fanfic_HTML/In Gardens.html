      <p><span>Neither  of them is sure how to start, but Bitterblue tries not to let that stop  them. She makes time for Hava, fitting her into her days and her heart  slowly, little by little. She would never have wished her father upon  any other soul, but she has Hava despite that, so she will gladly take  what she can get.</span><br/><br/><br/><span>Hava  is unsure, at first. She flickers between herself and other faces,  feeling small and unfit to be in the Lady Queen's rooms. She refuses to  call her by name; it is too grand and self-important. They speak of  little, meaningless things: the tea, the bread, the jam.</span><br/><br/><span>She is surprised that the Lady Queen kneads bread herself, these days. Hava knows how to make jam. </span><br/><br/><br/><span>They  explore gardens, together, when spring comes. The palace has many, but  the city has even more, and Hava knows them all. Surrounded by flowers,  Hava relearns letters, then words, and then whole worlds that erupt  behind her eyelids like magic, like some benevolent Grace where she  really<em> </em></span><em> <span>could</span></em> <span> be anyone. </span><br/><br/><span>For  her birthday, at the end of summer, the Lady Queen hands her a small  book, filled with illustrations that remind her of nothing so much as  her mother's statues, and stories that make her heart swell and sing  with joy. There is a cake, which she made for Hava herself. They are  surrounded by rosebushes and quiet.</span><br/><br/><span>"Happy Birthday, Hava. I hope they are </span> <em><span>all</span></em> <span> happy from now on."</span><br/><br/><span>Hava throws her arms around her, laughing and crying all at once. "Oh, </span> <em><span>Bitterblue</span></em><span>." It is the first time she has used her name, and Bitterblue understands what she means.</span><br/><br/><em> <span>Oh, sister.</span> </em><br/><br/></p>
