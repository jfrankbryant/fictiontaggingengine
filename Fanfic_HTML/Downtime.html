        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Since AO3 was down for awhile yesterday, I was forced to do something other than read fic. So I wrote fic about someone else bemoaning their fic archive being down :D</p><p>Thanks to werewolvesdontlikeyou on tumblr for the idea!</p></blockquote>

      <p>“No, no, no, no, no,” Kamala muttered, frantically clicking refresh. The error page didn’t change. “Why are you down?”</p><p>She blinked back sudden tears, mentally berating herself for her foolishness. Her favorite fanfiction site being down was no reason to cry even if the last chapter had ended in a cliffhanger where Captain Marvel seemingly died and she just really, really, <i>really</i> needed to read the next chapter and make sure everything turned out alright.</p><p>It was only a fic, but she was <i>invested</i>, ok?</p><p>A quick stop at the forums didn’t help at all since everyone else was as distraught over the sudden outage as she was. She really didn’t need to hear about everyone else’s crises since she had one of her own over the fic she was currently agonizing over.</p><p>(Captain Marvel would be alright, wouldn’t she? Kamala was pretty sure she hadn’t seen a major character death tag, but it wouldn’t be the first time she missed one in her excitement.)</p><p>The site’s tweeter wasn’t much help either. It was the same old ‘sorry, we know there’s an issue, we’re checking on it’ thing that she appreciated, really she did (she loved all the volunteers on the site, they were so great and she would love to give them a hug and maybe some chocolate chip cookies), but she needed to read the next chapter like <i>now</i>.</p><p>“Everything sucks,” she said, and refreshed the tweeter page again. Because obviously it would have changed in the two minutes that she’d been staring at it.</p><p>Well, not like she had anything better to do. (And no, the unfinished homework on the corner of her desk <i>totally</i> didn’t count.) It wasn’t going to help and it wasn’t making her feel better, but at least it was something to do.</p><p>It beat crying at least.</p>
