      <p>"They're coming, Klaus, hold on."</p><p>How it ended up this bad...</p><p>He couldn't even hold his own damn brother.</p><p>"I think I can hear the sirens, Klaus. Hold on, buddy."</p><p>Sometimes, in moments like this, Ben hated being dead.</p><p>Most of all,</p><p>He hated being the one to haunt the only sibling who could see him.</p><p>It made this harder.</p><p>It made seeing your brother in a dirty street bleeding out so much harder.</p><p>Yeah, there had been "friends", but all had bailed after help had been called.</p><p>All of them higher than Klaus was.</p><p>And none of them coming back.</p><p>Klaus groaned and rolled onto his back, swallowing hard as he looked at the clouds rolling through the sky. </p><p>"Stars." his voice was hoarse and he was a mess. </p><p>The cocaine still running through his system.</p><p>Ben shook his head at him, his eyes glistening with...something. He didn't want to cry in front of Klaus. </p><p>Not yet anyways.</p><p>He’d save that for another day.</p><p>"What?" He laughed, choking back his own sob. </p><p>"Stars. I can see the stars, Ben."</p><p>"You- You're literally bleeding out and all you can think about is stars?" </p><p>Klaus chuckled, stopping when the pain in his stomach became too much.</p><p>"I don't even know." </p><p>“Cool, I don’t either.” </p><p>Casual, keep him calm.</p><p>Red lights in the distance, Ben looked up and watched them grow closer. </p><p>"I'm right here." The sudden urge to protect hitting him, his brother would be fine.</p><p>"Don't be such a pansy."</p><p>"Don't be such an addict." </p><p>The ambulance stops, blue lights of police follow and he steps back, better to not be stepped through. </p><p>"Ben, come back." </p><p>"I can't... Help is here. I'm right here."</p><p>"Ben..."</p><p>The doors of the ambulance and cop cars opening and shutting, people approaching Klaus and talking to him.</p><p>"Ben I need you. Ben."</p><p>"Right here." He replied, keeping his voice calm.</p><p>A woman kneels down beside him, his eyes wild and searching as she shines a light in them.</p><p>"Sir? Sir? Do you know your name?"</p><p>"Ben?" Klaus mumbles again, confused.</p><p>"Right here." And he was, watching.</p><p>"Your name is Ben?" </p><p>"No. My brother right there..." He couldn't finish explaining, he was tired.</p><p>The woman looked over her shoulder, her partner looking up from the wound he was taping gauze over.</p><p>They were looking right through him.</p><p>"We can call your brother when we get you to the hospital." So much for being comforting.</p><p>He stood back and watched them tend to his brother, because he couldn't.</p><p>Sometimes he really hated being dead.</p>
