    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>After three years on his own, Bod was still mostly nocturnal by nature, and Athens after dark proved to his delight to be as lively as a graveyard—literally, not figuratively. The little taverna he had stumbled upon was lit low and golden, full of warm shadows, and smelled pleasantly of wine and roast chicken. Bod sat at a table in back, listening to the rapid patter of Greek conversation, and the strains of someone playing guitar outside, and the distant thumping drumbeat from the nightclub up the street.</p><p>And he watched the man at the corner table, carefully and with growing interest.</p><p>No one else seemed to notice him. That was precisely why Bod had. He was handsome. Big and dark—older, but not old—and most interestingly of all, he was Faded.</p><p>He was certainly alive. Bod had watched him eat and drink and saw his broad chest shallowly rising and falling with every breath. Not dead, then, nor undead. Yet he had a still, patient quality that was rare among the living. He was a traveller, like him; a well-worn pack sat on the chair beside him, upon which was perched a copy of what looked like Herodotus's <i>Histories</i> and an English-to-Greek phrase book. British, maybe, or American.</p><p>The man caught him looking, finally, and raised his eyebrows slightly. Bod blushed but managed a smile. The man had really nice eyelashes. He gathered his pluck and walked over, attempting a tactic that on two occasions had worked much better than what he had previously gleaned from Caius Pompeius. "Can I buy you a drink?"</p><p>His stomach fluttered as the man hesitated—seeming to flicker from surprised to mildly embarrassed to amused. He muttered what sounded like, 'When in Greece,' then chuckled and said, "Why not?"</p><p>Bod offered his hand. "I'm Nobody Owens."</p><p>For the first time since leaving home, there was no inquiry about his name. He understood why as a warm, strong hand folded around his own. "Shadow Moon."</p><p>He had a feeling they were going to get along.</p>
