    <h1>The Ruffian &amp; The Gentleman</h1>
    <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="http://archiveofourown.org/users/EllanaSan/pseuds/EllanaSan">EllanaSan</a></div>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The tips of his ears burned and he knew, he just <i>knew</i>, his face was crimson. He cleared his throat, poured himself some more wine and refused to acknowledged what had just happened. Because <i>Haymitch Abernathy</i> didn’t care what sort of language people used under his roof and he hadn’t just sounded like a Capitol with a pole in his ass.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Prompt: so, ah, yeah, your newest fic gave me an idea for a prompt ^^: “Language.” she chided anyway. He let out a long breath. It almost sounded pained. “Can’t tell you…” His voice was raw all of a sudden. “How much I fucking missed hearing you say that…” - Could you do one where it's just so common for Haymitch to hear that rebuke that at one point he automatically (accidentally) corrects the children when one of them curses? Thank you. - 13Fische</p></blockquote>

    <h2 class="toc-heading">The Ruffian &amp; The Gentleman</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p align="justify">There always came a point, when Johanna, Annie and little Finn visited, when Haymitch wondered why they kept inviting them.</p><p align="justify">And, as he met Effie’s irritated gaze across the dining table, he decided he was at that very point.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t Annie. Annie was always sweet and perfectly helpful and happy to see them. And little Finn was a delight even if he looked a little too much like his father and that always made Haymitch’s heart clench in his chest.</p><p align="justify">No…</p><p align="justify">Really, the problem was <em>Jo</em> and, more specifically, <em>Jo with Katniss</em>, and maybe it would have been fairer to wonder why they kept inviting <em>her </em>to visit Twelve during winter – then again, the girls always came over in winter for a week and they all went to Four in summer for a week too; it was a good system.</p><p align="justify">Jo and Katniss had a love-hate relationship none of them would ever pretend to understand – it was different than the weird love-hate friendship Johanna and Effie had fallen into though – but it was a <em>tiring</em> one. The girls could be best friends one minute and bicker incessantly the next.</p><p align="justify">They had spent <em>all </em>dinner time arguing about… He wasn’t even sure what they were arguing about but they were going at it wholeheartedly. Even Peeta was starting to shoot annoyed glances at his girlfriend. Annie, sweet as she was, was perfectly happy to chat with Effie and ignore the problem and Effie was too polite to ignore the victor but her eyes were meeting his more and more often and they were growing more and more annoyed by the minute.</p><p align="justify">If only they had kept their arguing to themselves…</p><p align="justify">But no.</p><p align="justify">They were being loud.</p><p align="justify">So loud he was starting to get a headache.</p><p align="justify">He downed his glass of wine and discreetly bumped his foot against Effie’s under the table. She lifted an eyebrow in question and he made a face, silently conveying just how ready he was for everyone to pack up and go back to the kids’ house. He wanted to call it a night. Maybe sit on the back porch with Effie for a while and watch the stars while drinking tea, huddled together for warmth – and enjoying <em>the peaceful silence</em>.</p><p align="justify">“Why do you always have to be such a <em>bitch</em>?” Katniss scowled.</p><p align="justify">“<em>I</em>’m the <em>bitch</em>?” Jo cackled, clearly enjoying herself. “You’re a <em>fucking</em>…”</p><p align="justify">“Language.” he snapped before Effie could even open her mouth.</p><p align="justify">The two girls stopped arguing to stare at him. Everyone was staring at him, really, even Annie in her aloof way.</p><p align="justify">The tips of his ears burned and he knew, he just <em>knew</em>, his face was crimson. He cleared his throat, poured himself some more wine and refused to acknowledged what had just happened. Because <em>Haymitch Abernathy</em> didn’t care what sort of language people used under his roof and he hadn’t <em>just</em> sounded like a Capitol with a pole in his ass.</p><p align="justify">Effie, bless her, swiftly came to his rescue by asking if anyone wanted some more dessert, not only distracting them but prompting the expected answer of “it’s late, we should head back”.</p><p align="justify">“What have you made of me, sweetheart?” he asked her very seriously later, when they were sitting outside on the swing seat, blissfully <em>alone</em>.</p><p align="justify">She giggled and plopped her legs on his lap. “Perhaps I <em>finally</em> managed to teach you some manners at last.”</p><p align="justify">He snorted. “<em>Fuck</em>, I hope not.”</p><p align="justify">She nudged his arm with her foot in reprimand for the curse but her smile was soft. “I caught myself <em>not</em> using a coaster the other day.”</p><p align="justify">He faked a gasp, placing his free hand on his chest. “You <em>don’t</em> say. I might have to call the press… The <em>scandal</em>…”</p><p align="justify">She chuckled and nudged him again but she settled when he rested his hand on her shin.</p><p align="justify">“I believe we have a <em>terrible</em> influence on each other, darling.” she hummed. “I am turning you into a civilized gentleman and you are turning me into quite the ruffian.”</p><p align="justify">He smirked, his eyes twinkling even as he took a sip of his scalding tea. “You’ve always been a ruffian, sweetheart… I’ve seen you in bed. Not really ladylike behavior…”</p><p align="justify">She laughed more frankly and tilted her head to the side. “Perhaps you just bring out that part of me…”</p><p align="justify">He slid his hand from her shin to her thigh. “Care to put that to the test?”</p><p align="justify">He didn’t have to ask twice. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>
