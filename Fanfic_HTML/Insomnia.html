    <h2 class="toc-heading">Insomnia</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Hermann has been lying awake for at least an hour when his phone chimes. He fumbles for it on the bedside table, finally plucking it from the charging pad. When he wakes the screen, he has a text notification.</p><p>From Newton.</p><p>Who is at a conference in Lima while Hermann is in Honolulu for another. He feels his brow furrowing even as he opens the text and peers blearily at the screen. Of course the fool is texting him at an hour when anyone reasonable would expect Hermann to be asleep. </p><p>
  <em>cant sleep, huh</em>
</p><p>Anyone reasonable who did not still have an inexplicable Drift-artifact telepathic connection with him.</p><p>
  <em>Not yet.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>take ur meds?</em>
</p><p>"Damn you," Hermann mutters. <em>The reception ran late.</em> His one social camouflage drink had become two and half of a third, and he did not like to take his pain medication too soon after drinking, and then it was late enough he was concerned about sleeping through his alarm, or not being clearheaded for the morning presentations.</p><p>
  <em>if u cant sleep cause your hips fucking with u ur gonna be fucked in the morning anyway</em>
</p><p>As Hermann was beginning an irritable reply, another text came. <em>sides, ur the gd rockstar there, nobodys gonna say shit if u miss morning session. its mostly the grad students anyway ull just make em crap themselves.</em></p><p>
  <em>I like to provide constructive feedback!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>u like making em crap themselves dont lie.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I regret my association with you daily.</em>
</p><p>Even as he tapped 'send', his chest tightened. A few minutes passed without a reply.</p><p><strike><em>I'm sorry</em></strike> <em><strike>Are you busy</strike></em> <strike><em>Don't mind me, I'm tired and it's hot and I miss</em></strike></p><p>Another message came through while he was deleting another attempt, with an image attached. Newton, shirtless but wearing sunglasses, with a day's worth of stubble. He had taken it holding his phone at arm's length, his tattoo of Yamarashi peeking over the edge of the frame. Even with the tinted lenses shielding his eyes he looked...a bit like Hermann felt. Tired. </p><p>Lonely.</p><p>Hermann finally looked at the accompanying words.</p><p>
  <em>u know you dont regret getting to tap this on the reg</em>
</p><p>A huff of laughter pushed its way past his lips. <em>You are ridiculous.</em></p><p>
  <em>yeah but im ur ridiculous.</em>
</p><p>Damn it, he was blushing. <em>You're going to be late. And shave, for God's sake.</em></p><p>
  <em>ill shave if you take ur meds</em>
</p><p>Herman lay the phone screen-down on his chest as he stared towards the ceiling, dimly visible in the ambient city light leaking past the closed curtains. Finally, he sighed, then rolled slowly onto his side. Using his phone for illumination, he uncapped the prescription bottle and swallowed two pills, chasing them with tepid water from the glass he'd put by his bed hours before. He rearranged the pillows, and pulled the sheet back up to his sternum.</p><p>
  <em>Fine, I took them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>ok good. thank you</em>
</p><p>Bloody hell, had some of his pain been leaking through their connection as well as his frustration? His chest felt tight again; he rubbed a hand over his stinging eyes.</p><p>
  <em>quit it u know ill be stupid about my meds at some point u can yell at me then</em>
</p><p>He snorted. <em>Not taking care of yourself should not be incentive.</em></p><p>
  <em>yeah but u know its gonna happen so just roll with it</em>
</p><p>He scrolled back up to the photo. He could make out the freckles scattered heavily across Newton's upper arms, in the rare blank spaces; he had gotten some sun on this trip. The wedge of upper chest that was visible showed dark chest hair. Hermann would never admit it, but he did enjoy the contrasts between their bodies, the ones that had nothing to do with Hermann's injury or Newton's obsession with body art. He touched his thumb to the hollow between Newton's shoulder and collarbone, emphasized by the angle of his arm.</p><p>The window scrolled down. <em>whoah, save some of that for when we get back.</em></p><p><em>There's too much to use before then.</em> He squinted at the screen. Did that even make sense?</p><p>
  <em>oh sure talk dirty to me before i gotta go into this presentation</em>
</p><p>
  <em>ppl already think i have a kaiju fetish</em>
</p><p>
  <em>having a stiffy while talking about the breach wont help</em>
</p><p>He laughed out loud. <em>Your own fault, but point taken. Go get ready. And shave!</em></p><p>
  <em>i promised didnt i? good night, sweet prince</em>
</p><p><em>Guten morgen</em> His thumb hovered over the 'm' before he tapped "Send". He darkened the screen, then reached out to blindly fumble the phone onto the charging pad. It took a few attempts before the wash of blue light indicating success. He folded his arms over his chest and closed his eyes.</p><p>Vibrating pressure against his Adam's apple almost startled him into opening his eyes again. It traveled up his throat and over his chin, then along his jaw.</p><p>Newton was shaving. Hermann smiled and let the undertow of the painkillers pull him down towards sleep.</p>
