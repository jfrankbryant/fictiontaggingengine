      <p>It started how it always started.</p><p>"Fuck off, Ben."</p><p>"Can't. Remember?" </p><p>"So then, just go in the other room."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Ben. I'm really not in the mood."</p><p>"...Fine." </p><p>After his brother had left him, Klaus turned over and pulled the comforter over his head. He hated this. He hated his power. </p><p>He hated his life.</p><p>Most importantly, he hated being sober.</p><p>The screams.</p><p>The taunts.</p><p>The...everything.</p><p>He sighed heavily and threw back the covers, instantly hot.</p><p>"Ben...Will you come back?"</p><p>Hearing the sigh of resignation, he watched as his brother came back.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Ben was sitting on the edge of the bed, not indent or markings that he was. No dip in the matress.</p><p>Of course not, being dead and all. </p><p>Ben understood some of how Klaus worked, the highs and lows. The anger at their father and the pity for their mother. </p><p>He watched how Klaus would live and die and manage. </p><p>This was a low moment, when the voices that screamed scared him so much that he was like that kid their father had locked up to teach him to not be afraid. </p><p>Klaus shook a bit and whimpered. </p><p>"Don't leave me alone."</p><p>Ben's hand ghosted over his back, leaving him with a chill.</p><p>It would never be warm again, but it was comfort nonetheless. </p><p>"I won't."</p>
