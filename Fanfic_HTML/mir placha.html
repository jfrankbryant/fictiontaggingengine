  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p><p>It was the middle of the night. Being awoken by a high-pitched drip in the middle of the goddamn night is unpleasant to say the least.</p><p>As the annoying ringing continued, the man wondered why he chose that ringtone. He was about to throw the thing at the wall, and then he saw the Caller ID.</p><p>He didn’t bother with a greeting, simply started with, “Vanya?”</p><p>There was no reply, only silence. He was an expert on his sister’s silences.</p><p>“Vanya,” He repeated more firmly, “What’s wrong?”</p><p>He noticed the hesitant breathing now, her effort to find resolve.</p><p>Finally, there was a whisper, “She’s back. The White Eyed Lady is back.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Note: Before anyone ask, yes I named Five 'Felix.' I don't know why, but I like the name. Also the cat. </p>

  <p>BREAKING NEWS</p>
<hr/><p>Mary Way [newscaster]: For our viewers who are just tuning in, we are looking at live images from a scene that is being called a police investigation and- possibly a crime scene- at the Hargreeves Manor on Kinsley Avenue, about fifteen miles outside of the city. Known as the remarkably private Umbrella Academy, Reginald Hargreeves owns and operates this establishment.</p><p>A source just told CGN that all police command staff left their departments for this scene about an hour ago...</p><p>We are now receiving a call from the scene... and we have confirmation that the six residing children have been removed from the house and are at the hospital. We do not know where their legal guardian, Reginald Hargreeves is. James, are there any updates on the circumstances prompting the police presence?</p><p>James Graham [onsite reporter]: The police are still investigating the house and not giving any comments currently. What we do know is the neighbors found the children outside late last night. They were concerned and called the police, who are here now.</p><p>Way: Do we know if there are any other adults in the house?</p><p>Graham: According to previous reports, there is a staff. A few are in official positions and have remained since the beginning of the Umbrella Academy. The Hargreeves also the only six official students. Right now, we are not seeing anyone from the academy other than the children.</p><p>Way: And they have been taken to the hospital by the neighbors? From what I have been told, the nearest residence close to the academy is about five miles away.</p><p>Graham: Yes, we were able to get a report that the children left the academy by car. One of the boys drove to the nearest house to ask for help...</p><p>Oh! We just got an update! The police are coming out..., they are calling for… oh my. They found a body.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>“One! Two!”</p><p>It was a special day at the house. Father and Pogo were out, no tasks needed to be done, and Mom ended classes early. For the first time in a long time, the kids had a day off. No matter that it was pouring rain outside, it was a day off!</p><p>Allison wanted nothing more than to read the latest Teen Vogue issue and begin the trashy romance novel she snuck into the house. She had to stifle a groan when Mom told her she needed to watch her little brothers and sister instead.</p><p>The siblings decided to play a casual game of Hide and Seek that quickly became a competition between Luther, Diego, and Felix on who could hide their kids the longest. Diego dragged Ben away, Felix took Vanya, and Luther had Klaus. Allison got the job as a referee to keep Diego and Luther from accusing each other of cheating... Something she felt was a lost cause.</p><p>“Three! Klaus! Shut up! Four”</p><p>As Luther continued to count down loudly, she could hear Klaus giggling from under the sideboard, but Ben and Vanya kept quiet wherever they were put.</p><p>“Ten! Ready or not, here we come!”</p><p>Diego and Luther fanned out, searching throughout the wide corridor that they chose as their playfield, kneeling to check underneath the furniture and opening whatever closet doors they came across. While they unsuccessfully searched, Felix zeroed in on Klaus’ giggling and looked behind the sideboard.</p><p>"I win!" Felix stood proudly with Klaus swinging on his leg, a massive grin plastered on his face.</p><p>Luther frowned at their little brother, "Klaus!" and a little pink tongue stuck out in his direction.</p><p>Allison despairingly wondered what life would be like with more sisters, rolling her eyes upwards in a silent plea for patience, and said, "You still need to find Ben and Vanya."</p><p>"Fine." Felix turned to Klaus, "A bag of cookies if you know where Ben is."</p><p>"Hey!" Diego yelled. "That's not fair!"</p><p> Klaus pointed to the small parlor room to their left. "Ben's over there!" His toothy smile became impossibly wide— the little brat.</p><p>Luther and Felix dashed over to the room, while Diego insisted that it didn't count because Five cheated and Klaus was "gonna get it" later. Klaus just laughed.</p><p>Luther shoved aside the desk, revealing Ben and his growling stomach.</p><p>"I'm hungry," Ben announced.</p><p>"I'm getting cookies!" Klaus bragged.</p><p>Ben's eyes widened with jealousy, "I want cookies!" he said as he jumped up.</p><p>Allison smiled and suggested, "Maybe Mom finished making lunch; why don't we go to the kitchen?"</p><p>"But we still haven't found Vanya!" Diego protested. Luther nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Then I declare Felix the winner,” Allison said.</p><p>“He’s disqualified! He cheated!” Diego argued.</p><p>"He still won," Allison retorted with disinterest and crossed her arms. "Felix, please get Vanya."</p><p>Felix meandered over to the "bear wardrobe" (christened by the children for the giant bear carving on its doors). He opened the elegant double doors and called in, "Vanya, we won. You can come out."</p><p>Silence reigned.</p><p>Felix pushed aside the long uniforms, overcoats, and other articles of clothing. "Vanya, did you fall asleep?" He asked, peering inside the enormous wardrobe.</p><p>He kept searching, his entire body nearly engulfed by the wardrobe. Panic started to bubble up in his chest when he still could not find Vanya, making his motions quick and clumsy.</p><p>Allison felt her stomach tightening.</p><p>"What's going on?" Diego asked tentatively.</p><p>Luther narrowed his eyes, "Five, if you're messing with us..."</p><p>Felix whipped around, trying to regulate his breathing, "She was right here!"</p><p>Allison noticed Ben and Klaus weren't arguing about cookies anymore, instead standing quiet and subdued. Trying to ease their young minds and avoid any crying and panic, she said, "Maybe she snuck outside. We just need to find her."</p><p>"Let's find her!" Luther directed, slipping into his 'I'm the oldest' voice.</p><p>Allison nodded in agreement as Felix ran ahead of everyone. Diego followed with Ben and Klaus behind him.</p><p>The house was massive. Countless rooms lined every corridor, several of them filled with closets, curtains, and furniture, all fighting for space. Each corridor and room offered several potential hiding spots for Vanya to slide into. The first corridor Allison and Luther checked was narrow and housed a linen closet, but no Vanya. The duo moved towards a small room under a staircase, fruitlessly searching for Vanya. Their panic grew with each failed search, to the point they looked under the beds and behind the curtains.</p><p>“Where is she?!”</p><p>Allison couldn't help but think of all the dangerous places Vanya could have snuck into - the boiler room, the roof, the west wing balcony with the broken railing, the entire east wing…</p><p>Her stomach stopped tightening with a lurch, the tightly wound coil growing cold.</p><p>“Let’s go back,” Luther said, “Vanya’s is probably under the couch, and we just didn’t see.”</p><p>Allison muttered "fine," and they returned to the southeastern wing. As they moved closer, she could hear Diego yelling at Ben and Klaus, asking them if they knew where Vanya was. There seemed to be only one answer.</p><p>“The ladies took her!” Klaus announced, “They came when she was sleeping! She told me!”</p><p>“Don’t lie!” Diego scolded.</p><p>“He’s not lying!” Ben defended Klaus.</p><p>Felix kneeled and looked at Klaus, “If the ladies took her, where did they put her?”</p><p>“The pit!” Klaus replied with conviction, “They took her to the pit for the troll!”</p><p>Diego scoffed, “Mom needs to stop reading you that stupid story.!”</p><p>Luther's stony mask began to falter as he asked, "Where is she?"</p><p>Allison tried to ignore the cold pit resting in her stomach, replying, “I don’t know. Vanya wouldn’t make us worry about her- Unless someone talked her into it.”</p><p>Felix glared at her and growled, “No one talked her into anything, she’s missing, and we need to find her.”</p><p>Allison wanted to smack him, “I know that! But we don’t know where she is!”</p><p>“Maybe you would if you actually paid attention!” Felix barked.</p><p>“Hey! You were in charge of Vanya! Don’t go after Allison!” Luther argued.</p><p>Allison trudged off, needing distance from her loud brothers to think. She had a headache, and her eyes were stinging from oncoming tears. Maybe they did need to get mom, or just search again. Better yet, maybe she should smack all her brothers for being the absolute worst.</p><p>She felt a tug at her arm and looked down to see Klaus.</p><p>“What is it, Klaus?”</p><p>“She came back!”</p><p>“What?” Allison frowned.</p><p>“They brought her back! We need to get her!” Klaus was gently pulling her towards the wardrobe, trying to get her to come with him.</p><p>“Klaus, stop. We can’t find Vanya, and you’re not helping-“</p><p>“Listen!” Klaus interrupted, “She’s back!”</p><p>As if she were following an order, Allison stopped thinking, stopped talking and listened. She could then hear whimpering, so fragile and familiar.</p><p>“Guys!” Allison yelled, “I hear her! I think she’s still here!”</p><p>Her brother's bickering disappeared, allowing the corridor to be filled with Vanya's muffled crying.</p><p>"I hear it from the wardrobe!" She said, and they all started to run.</p><p>Felix arrived at the wardrobe first, frantically swinging the doors open. Vanya was there, crouched low on the wardrobe floor, her eyes puffy and red as tears tracked down her cheeks. She raised her head with a sniff and mewled out, "Five."</p><p>Felix grabbed her into his arms and carried her out of the wardrobe.</p><p>“Where were you?” he choked out, holding her tight.</p><p>“I was here!” Vanya cried pathetically.</p><p>Allison walked up to her, saying in a low, soothing voice, “Vanya, we were really scared. You should’ve stayed in your hiding place.”</p><p>Vanya was now indignant, her eyes narrowed, and nose flared, “I was here! The whole time! You didn’t hear me!”</p><p>Later, they decided that it was nothing. Vanya probably snuck away because Luther and Diego were arguing. Then, when she decided to come back and noticed everyone was gone, she got scared. She’s little, so she doesn’t know any better. But it was okay now.</p><p>Vanya was safe, her face was clean and tear free, eating her sandwich and drinking milk with Klaus and Ben and everything was okay. Mom told Luther and Diego not to fight so much and be more careful with their siblings. She also told Vanya to not to sneak off next time.  Mom said that they could watch the television after lunch. So everything was okay.</p><p>It was okay.</p>
