    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Kaijuu never attack at a good time.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>Fuckers.</p><p>Ruining one of the best nights they’ve had in a while.</p><p>It’s not often they get a chance to do this.  Not like the walls transfer sound all that well - the docs discovered sex is drift-enhancing in the first few months of the program, and a little extra privacy was built into the barracks design as a result.  Or that rumors spread fast - they do, but in the Shatterdome, everybody’s too focused on the future’s ruin to care much about today’s indiscretions.  Or that it’s suspicious that they share quarters - most Jaeger teams do, family or otherwise.  </p><p>None of that’s really the reason why Herc doesn’t get to spread Chuck out and fuck him into oblivion on a nightly basis.  </p><p>No.  </p><p>Chuck - little prissy brat - refuses to do anything particularly <i>athletic</i> if Max is around.  Watching them.  The way every fucking dog that Herc has ever fucking owned does.  They’re predators.  Their eyes are drawn by the movement.</p><p>“He’s family!” the boy protested, the first time Herc pointed out how stupid that was to care about.</p><p>Sometimes, Chuck drives him fucking crazy.</p><p>But tonight, Max is hanging out in LOCCENT with Tendo and there’s not a wet nose in sight and the irritation of the past three nights when Chuck wouldn’t let Herc do this just makes it that much better.</p><p>Which is why they’re like this.  Chuck’s chest on the bed and ass in the air, the soft skin stained red from that spanking they both know he damn well deserves after the way he’s been behaving this week, the boy moaning like a whore, rolling back against his father’s thrusts.  Herc’s hands are roaming everywhere as he drills deep - pulling almost all the way out and slamming home until his balls hit - admiring that rising flush he put there on that tanned skin, the fine lines of the young body he loves so much, sweat rising, heat growing. </p><p>Nothing's ever hidden within Ranger teams, nothing ever denied, and if this is the form it takes for them, Herc couldn’t give two shits what the rest of the world thinks.  Not when it feels this good.  Not when he can feel his co-pilot almost as keenly as he can in the drift, as closely, like they’re inside the same skin...</p><p>And he’s so close, almost there, squeezing Chuck’s ass down around his cock, buried deep down now, groaning as Chuck clenches down, chasing his own climax - nights like this, he comes on Herc’s cock or he doesn’t come at all - when the intercom goes off.</p><p>Tendo.</p><p>Motherfucker.</p><p>He’s so close, so close it hurts, and based on the way Chuck’s moaning right now...</p><p>
  <i>Kaijuu, spotted a hundred kilometers from the Gold Coast.  Suit up, guys.</i>
</p><p>“Dad,” Chuck groans, reaching back to grab Herc’s wrist, before the older Hansen can slap the younger on the ass one last time and pull out, “dad, come on, don’t be a fucking jerk here.  Please...”</p><p><i>Fuck it,</i> he decides, and glances at the clock.  Slaps that hand down around Chuck’s mouth instead to shut him up, and starts jackhammering in even as he reaches over a sweaty twenty-year old shoulder and hits the mic.</p><p>“Copy that.  ETA five minutes.”  They can wait five minutes.  No good having Chuck horyn-distracted in the drift.</p><p>
  <i>”Herc...”</i>
</p><p>He switches it off, slips that hand back under Chuck and drops the rest of the way down onto his boy’s back.  “You want it, kiddo,” he whispers, and nips the soft skin of his jaw, eyes locked on the clock above the radio, “make it fast.”</p><p>It takes him exactly sixty-three seconds to get Chuck off.  Another five before Herc’s coming himself, driven over the edge by the way his boy’s body spasms around his.  </p><p>They’re wiped down, dressed, and relatively presentable in another hundred and twenty.</p><p>If anybody they pass on their way to the Conn-Pod, or the LOCCENT guys, notice anything or hear anything a little off, well, they keep it to their damn selves.</p><p>“You could have at least put a plug in me or something, dad,” Chuck whines, as they run through the launch sequence, right before the drop, vox turned off.  “I’m gonna ruin my suit like this.”</p><p>Herc just smiles to himself.  The thought of his come, still sloshing around inside his boy does - evidently - <i>things</i> to him.  “Clench up,” he suggests, “and fight fast.”</p><p>The look Chuck gives him is more than worth it.</p><p>The kaijuu’s a class three.  Rough fight, but short. </p><p>Thank fuck.</p><p>Because the neural handshake almost doesn’t stick, sparking as it is with post-orgasmic haze, and Chuck’s arousal at Herc’s orders right before heading out - <i>adorable little bastard</i>, Herc thinks fondly, and keeps  <i>that</i> dangerous thought far from his son - and Herc’s own embarrassingly orange-keen need to get back into that slick, warm, delicious place, still open and ready for him...</p><p>Rough, but short.</p><p>It’s smooth when they get back, all the little bumps of anger and irritation and frantic need turned to waterslicked glass by the drift, by combat, Chuck sighing a little, wriggling tired shoulders deeper into the pillows as Herc slides home.  </p><p>“You stink, old man,” he whispers, rubbing the inside of a knee up along the older Hansen’s ribs.  </p><p>Herc uses it as an excuse to curl fingers into helmet-damp hair, and kiss his boy breathless.</p>
