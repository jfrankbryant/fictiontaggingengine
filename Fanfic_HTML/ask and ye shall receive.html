      <p><em>Smite me,</em> Crowley thinks one day, about three or four days into the Beginning of the World. <em>You cast me out, why not just finish it off? </em></p><p>He feels rather daring about it, especially when God doesn’t answer. Puts a bit of a swagger in his slither, or so he tries to tell himself. </p><p>If he’s being honest with himself (which he hardly ever is), it’s not the the daring of standing up to someone, but the daring of standing at the edge of a cliff with a backpack that may or may not contain a parachute and opening your mouth to invite a person (who may or may not be standing behind you) to give you a good hard shove. It is exhilarating. It is terrifying.</p><p>It quickly goes downhill from there.</p><p>It becomes a silent litany over the next few days. He tries to provoke Her, mostly by thinking a lot of annoying questions as loudly as he can, because that worked the first time. It doesn’t work now. He might as well be alone with his thoughts.</p><p>He tries new things – he dunks ducks underwater, he convinces one particularly nimble mosquito to buzz right around Adam’s left ear for four hours straight, he uproots plants here and there. <em>Smite me,</em> he thinks. <em>I’m meddling. I’m putting my sticky fingers all over this lovely thing You made. Smite me.</em></p><p><em>Smite me. I’ll make them touch that thing you said not to touch. I’ll do it. Don’t think I won’t, because I will. </em>And he does, to boot. Adam and Eve eat the apple, and he turns his back for two seconds and they get kicked out. He’s furious – God <em>is</em> apparently paying attention, just not to him. He’s going to have to escalate things, and he looks around for something that might be more precious to Her than a bloody tree.</p><p><em>Smite me</em>, he taunts. <em>Smite me down. Look how evil I am, oooooh, I’m talking to this angel on the wall, I might </em>tempt<em> him if You’re not careful, God. COME ON, YOU COWARD, DO IT. </em></p><p>He doesn’t hear Her reply. He hasn’t heard any of Her replies, and in any case he’s very busy talking to the angel about that flaming sword, but nevertheless She answers:<em> Smiting, is it? Well, if you insist.</em></p><p>The angel mumbles, almost too quiet to hear, “I gave it away,” and Crowley is… poleaxed. Utterly poleaxed, and more than a little impressed, and so delighted that he entirely forgets his other, silent conversation. </p><p>“You <em>what</em>?” </p><p>“I gave it <em>away</em>!” cries the angel.</p><p><em>There</em>, God says, infinitely satisfied with Herself: <em>There. You’re smitten.</em></p>
