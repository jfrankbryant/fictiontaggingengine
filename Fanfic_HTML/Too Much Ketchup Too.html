    <div class="userstuff">
      <p><i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> has this to say on the
subject of kissing: <i>Why it is that a large percentage of
    intelligent species in the galaxy find mashing their food-intake
    orifices together to be a highly pleasurable experience is a
    matter of considerable debate among sociologists, philosophers,
    and talk-show hosts.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that on many
    worlds, kissing is a primary form of recreation, but the traveler
    should be cautious when approaching locals.  For example, on
    Pleiades Delta it is considered an invitation to duel.</i>

</p><p>Arthur and Fenchurch had not read this particular entry, and even
  if they had, it is doubtful that it would have affected their
  enjoyment of the practice (and of mashing other orifices
  together as well) for the duration of their time in the cargo hold.
  In fact, they were so taken with it
  that Ford was usually left alone with nothing to do besides carving
  naughty words into the bulkhead with a screwdriver.

</p><p>"Look," said Ford, as the happy couple attempted to seclude themselves behind a box of condiments, "either you're going to
  have to teach me very rude insults in several new
  languages, or you'll have to let me in on the fun."

</p><p>"What?" said Fenchurch.

</p><p>"Are you making a pass at my girlfriend?" asked Arthur.

</p><p>"Well, either her or you," said Ford.  "I'm sufficiently bored that
  it really doesn't matter anymore.  Did you know that this ship is
  carrying twelve varieties of ketchup but not a single
  case of alcohol?"

</p><p>"It's either both of us or nothing," said Fenchurch.

</p><p>Arthur was still looking back and forth between her and Ford and
  stammering when Ford kissed him.

</p><p>"Well," Arthur said after a moment, "it's too bad we don't have a Dire
  Straits record, but I suppose we'll have to make do."</p>
