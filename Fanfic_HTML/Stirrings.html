  <p>‘<em>He was sitting really close to me. I could feel his warmth. He looked at me, and smiled. It made me melt. “Asher…” He cooed. “Asher, I love you…” He whispered to him. I smiled. “I love you too, Jonas…” I heard myself say. He grinned, and leaned into me. He pressed his lips to mine, and I pressed back. He tasted so sweet.</em>’ Asher woke up in a cold sweat. “W-what… What was that?” He mumbled, looking down at the pale sheets. To make it even more weird, it was Jonas. His best friend.</p>

  <p>‘<em>”Asher!” I screamed. I could feel him, gripping my hips. He moaned, thrusting hard into my lower regions. This was breaking so many rules. “Jonas…” He gasped out between thrusts. “Ugh! Harder!” I heard myself whimper. He complied, hitting something down there that made me see stars. I came, spilling my seed on my chest. He thrusted a few more times, before groaning and climaxing inside me. “I love you, Jonas.” He mumbled into my ear. “I love you too, Asher…”</em> ‘ Jonas woke up with a jerk, eyes darting down the the wetness near his lower regions. He made a mess of his sheets. ‘Is it sad that I want that to be a reality?’ He thought to himself as he changed his bedding.</p>

  <p>‘<em> I scooted closer to her. She was so pretty, I couldn’t stand it. Her long curly hair, pale eyes, were so alluring. She was glowing, so full of life. I pressed my lips to her cheek, it tasted like cherries. It stuck to my lips. She giggled, putting her arms around my neck. “So beautiful.” I said, praising her. She pressed her lips my forehead, mumbling, “I love you, Fiona.” I smiled. “I love you too, Rosemary.”</em> ‘ Fiona yawned, batting her eyes open from such a lovely dream.</p>

  <p>‘<em> She touched me. She put her hands on my breasts, and rubbed them. It felt so good. I heard myself gasp, and lean into her gentle touch. “Fiona~!” I mewled. She kissed my neck in such a delicious way. I ran my hands through her long red hair. It was so gorgeous, I loved it so much. She moved south, taking my skirt off. “You look so tasty, Rosemary.” She said, licking her lips. I could feel my thighs tremble. She was so close to my private area that I needed the most attention to. “I love you, Fiona.” “Mhmm…”</em> ‘  Rosemary gripped her sheets, opening her eyes. ‘That was a highly pleasant dream’, she thought.</p>
