      <p>
  <strong>Disclaimer: I do not claim any ownership over The Hunger Games whatsoever. I do not gain anything, profit or otherwise, from writing in this universe.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I also do not condone underage drinking, which may be touched on in the course of this story. My personal feelings towards alcohol use is to please do it responsibly.</strong>
</p><hr/><p>Before I begin, I want to say one thing.</p>
<p>I love my wife. She means everything to me. All that I am, have been, and ever will be belongs to her and her alone.</p>
<p>That being said, I hope she will understand why I am writing this.</p>
<p>The most amazing thing about Katniss is how wonderfully complex she is. Most of the world knows her in so few aspects – a volunteer for her sister in the Hunger Games, a daughter who lost her father too soon, a huntress who always found her mark, a Victor…and of course, the Mockingjay. A select few know her as a provider, a protector, and even a friend.</p>
<p>I know her as my wife, the mother of my children, the love of my life…</p>
<p>And also as a fascinating and entertaining drunk.</p>
<p>Maybe I should explain myself before going any further.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, Katniss is a highly guarded person – or she was, a long time ago. Since we’ve been together, though, she has started to come out of her shell a bit.</p>
<p>I like to believe it’s because of my influence, but I digress.</p>
<p>The point is that even as we’ve moved on in our life together, Katniss continues to be very…protective of her innermost thoughts, feelings, and emotions. I suppose it’s a result of all those years in the past when they were used against her by so many.</p>
<p>You might think, as her husband, that she’d be more open with me; that I’d be given an ‘all access pass,’ so to speak.</p>
<p>Nope. Not that lucky.</p>
<p>I can’t really blame her, though. After all that time having to hold everything in, I certainly can’t expect her to immediately become an open book, even with me. It’s one of those things that makes her ‘Katniss,’ the woman who now holds my heart.</p>
<p>Besides, it’s not like I haven’t ever seen behind the iron wall she puts up around other people.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right. There are times that Katniss lets her guard down completely and shows off her heart to the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it usually only happens when she’s drunk.</p>
<p>It makes me a little uncomfortable, knowing that she doesn’t feel like she can be free when she’s sober, but at the same time, I can’t help but think of how beautifully honest she can be when she’s under the influence.</p>
<p>And that part – the rarely seen, unguarded, open and sincere Katniss – is who I’m writing about today.</p>
<p>Even though she’ll probably beat me up over it.</p>
<p>But it would be worth it, to have everyone know that she does have a softer side.</p>
<p>And so, without further ado, may I present…</p>
<p>The drunken states of Katniss Everdeen-Mellark, as written by her husband, yours truly, Peeta Mellark.</p><hr/><p>
