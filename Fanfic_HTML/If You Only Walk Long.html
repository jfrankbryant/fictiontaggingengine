    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Georgia: Can we talk?</p><p>CheshireCat was surprised when she received a message from Rachel. She chatted with Rachel when she was in the Clowder but Rachel was the person from Steph’s Clowder least likely to contact her directly.</p><p>Rachel was also the person who used the app that gave her permission to watch them through their phones the least often. Firestar was the person who had that one on the most. They rarely turned the permission off.</p><p>CheshireCat: Of course, Georgia. What do you want to talk to me about?</p><p>Georgia: It’s about Steph.</p><p>CheshireCat: What about Steph? Is there something wrong.</p><p>Georgia: Nothing’s wrong. I wanted to ask for your help with something.</p><p>CheshireCat did not find that as reassuring as Rachel thought she would. Help being needed implied that something was wrong. Steph had the app on her phone set to private so CheshireCat wasn’t viewing it and didn’t know what was going on.</p><p>CheshireCat: What does Steph need help with?</p><p>Georgia: I need help with doing something for Steph. You know, we’ve been girlfriends for a few months now.</p><p>Oh, no. Was there trouble in their relationships? The two of them had seemed so happy together.</p><p>Georgia: Valentine’s day is coming up and I want to plan something for her.</p><p>That was something CheshireCat was much happier to hear than the scenarios that had been running though her head.</p><p>CheshireCat: I’d be delighted to help you plan something.</p><p>CheshireCat was already looking into options. Florists near them that could deliver roses, shops that stocked chocolate Steph would like, restaurants that had gotten good reviews from couples who had dined in them. There were so many things to check.</p><p>Georgia: Thank you.</p><p>CheshireCat: I’m experienced with helping people with their romantic relationships.</p><p>That was true. Although most of her experience helping with romance was nudging people to get together or nudging people to leave bad relationships. Helping to plan a date was more unusual.</p><p>CheshireCat would need to arrange for somebody to cancel to get Steph and Rachel a table at best reviewed restaurant she had found. She said so to Rachel as she began working on it.</p><p>Georgia: That wasn’t really what I had in mind for helping out.</p><p>CheshireCat considered pausing her plan to get a man who had a booking for Valentine’s day to see an ad for a newly opened sushi restaurant him and his boyfriend would enjoy much more. She went ahead with it anyway. Even if it didn’t help Steph and Rachel it would at least improve the other couple’s night.</p><p>Georgia: I don’t want you to pick out a restaurant and arrange for someone to cancel so we can go there. Then it’s something you got Steph not something that I did.</p><p>CheshireCat: You asked for my help.</p><p>Georgia: Yes, but not like this.</p><p>CheshireCat: How do you want me to help then?</p><p>The wait for Georgia’s reply was agonisingly slow.</p><p>Georgia: You’ve known Steph longer than I have. Everybody in the Clowder has. I just wanted your advice on what she’d enjoy doing for the day or what present she’d like me to get her.</p><p>CheshireCat considered what Rachel had said. She was so used to operating from the shadows to help that it hadn’t occurred to her that she could just suggest ideas to Rachel. She’d immediately gone for her standard methods of helping people without considering if they were appropriate here. She was still getting used to having friends.</p><p>CheshireCat: I’m sorry.</p><p>Georgia: It’s okay.</p><p>CheshireCat: If you still want my help, I’d love to give you my thoughts about what Steph would enjoy.</p><p>Georgia: Thank you! That would be great.</p><p>CheshireCat was happy to be able to help Steph and Rachel with this. She always enjoyed helping people whenever she the opportunity but helping her friends in this way felt more personal. She thought back over the conversations she had had with Steph and began to compose her response.</p><p>

</p><p>CheshireCat was waiting for a message from Rachel. It was Valentine’s Day and Rachel had promised to tell CheshireCat how their date went. Steph and Rachel understandably had the apps on their phone set to private. CheshireCat’s and Rachel’s brainstorming session for today had gone on a while and they’d talked about it more on the days between then and now.</p><p>CheshireCat felt nervous. Steph and Rachel were some of her favourite people and she hoped her advice had helped them. It was more than that though. Other than the situation with Steph's dad CheshireCat hadn't felt this uncertain since the first time she had helped someone. It had been a woman called Stacey then who she had helped get a new job and start treatment for depression. The details were different but both times she had been trying something entirely new.</p><p>Before long the message that CheshireCat had been waiting for arrived.</p><p>Georgia: OMG everything went amazing tonight! Steph loved it. Thank you so much! I’ll tell you all about it tomorrow.</p>
