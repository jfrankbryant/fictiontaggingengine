      <p>His daddy never hit him. Mama's still alive and kickin' it up in Florida. He sends her a postcard now and then, just to let her know he's still breathing. He's got two brothers and a sister. He makes more money than all of them combined and he sends it home; Mama makes sure to spread the wealth.</p><p>His daddy never hit him. He knows what Nate thinks, what they all think.</p><p>After all, why would someone learn to defend themselves so damned well if they didn't need to defend themselves from something?</p><p>But his daddy never hit him. He actually grew up fairly well-off, and attended a good school, and played fucking football and baseball and volunteered at a stable on the weekends whenever he had the time.</p><p>And, except for the stable, he was <i>so fucking bored</i> he sometimes thought about breaking heads just to liven things up a bit.</p><p>His daddy never hit him. His daddy actually died in a carwreck when he was eighteen and he used the chaos after that to split.</p><p>He sends postcards and money and never even thinks about going home.</p><p>He doesn't belong there. Never has.</p>
