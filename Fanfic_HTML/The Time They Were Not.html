      <p>You are driving Shadow’s car as fast as it will go and you can’t really breathe.</p><p>“That asshole,” you just keep repeating.</p><p>“I can take over if you need me to,” Shadow says. “At the next exit.”</p><p>“That asshole,” you repeat. You’re still not entirely sure why you’re upset or when you’ll stop being that way.</p><p>“Don’t listen to him. He is a walking, talking piece of shit.”</p><p>“Is he really after me?”</p><p>“Us. After us.”</p><p>“What the hell is going on?”</p><p>“I don’t know the whole story…” Shadow starts. “When we see the next In n’ Out let’s pull over, I’ll buy us lunch and I’ll try to explain.</p><p>“You’re buying me a burger? Are we on a date?”</p><p>“I mean….”</p><p>“I’m kidding, I’m kidding.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know, but I mean...well not right now.”</p><p>You laugh. “I really was kidding. It sounds like you’re sort of not, though.”</p><p>“I mean, I’m just saying that I wouldn’t be opposed to, you know, like, dates with queers. Other queers. Besides the ones we know.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“So am I buying you lunch or not?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>You sit in the restaurant and Shadow is mostly watching out the window. “So I don’t know a lot,” he says, “But Mr. Wednesday--I mean, Odin, I guess--he’s been warning me.”</p><p>“Warning you. About a war?”</p><p>“About a war. Between the old forces and new. Between him and Technical Boy.”</p><p>“Technical Boy?”</p><p>“The asshole. I think he got in through computer wires or something, he’s a sick fuck who probably invented ASCII porn.”</p><p>“Ugh, one of those.”</p><p>“And Usenet.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“And, you know, other stuff, IRC, stuff you use.”</p><p>“Stuff everyone is using.”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>You nod.</p><p>“So, my brother, my father, people like my family,” you suddenly are admitting, “They hunt things like him.”</p><p>“Really? No shit?”</p><p>“No shit. Completely not shitting you.”</p><p>“That’s….”</p><p>“It would be okay if they weren’t complete pieces of dung beetle.”</p><p>“Shit, yeah, I’m sorry.”</p><p>“My dad drinks like a fish….Sam...Uh. Sam is… just… well, he likes to hunt. Like, monsters. But I think...if there weren’t monsters… Sam would still...hunt things. People.”</p><p>“Shit, Dean.”</p><p>“Sam is...I don’t know. I basically raised him by myself, so maybe it’s my fault.”</p><p>“Tinker Bell. It is not your fault.”</p><p>You snap to attention and search Shadow’s face. He’s not looking out the window anymore. He’s looking at you. Dead at you.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“I’m sure. Eat your fries or I’m gonna steal ‘em. We’re going to need calories for this mess.”</p><p>“I kind of love you.”</p><p>Shadow smiles. “I know.”</p>
