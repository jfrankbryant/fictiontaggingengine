      <p><span>She  hadn't intended it to happen. Then again, Bitterblue had never intended  a great many things to happen, and had long given up regretting them  individually.</span><br/><br/><span>Her  office was warm with the promise of a hot summer, afternoon light  catching the dust. Teddy sat across from her at her desk, going through  reports of new schools with her, animated at the actual, true progress  of education in the city. He had agreed to be her Minister for Education  two years before, after half a year of helping part time and getting  frustrated with better ways to do things. She was so, so glad he had  joined her in this. In many ways she wasn't sure she could have  weathered the fallout of the conspiracy without him.</span><br/><br/><span>There  had been objections, of course, to allowing this son of resistance  fighters and associate of petty criminals to be her Minister of just  about anything. Teddy hadn't seemed to mind those, just got to work  designing school programs and helping her find ways to make sure her  people would not be too burdened with work to attend if they chose. It  was compulsory for children to fourteen; adults could go if they wanted.  With the gradual, true spread of literacy, more and more people came  forward with accounts written in careful, big letters of what Leck had  done or stole. She entrusted those to Death.</span><br/><br/><span>Teddy coughed, then smiled, drawing her out of her reverie. "I'm boring you. I'll go--we can go over these later."</span><br/><br/><span>"No, Teddy, sorry. I don't know where my mind was. You can finish."</span><br/><br/><span>"Lady  Queen," he said, standing and bowing slightly. "I'll give you a break  from this. We can at least go see if there are any treats in the  kitchen."</span><br/><br/><span>Smiling, she stood and joined him.</span><br/><br/><br/><span>There </span> <em><span>were</span></em> <span> treats, apple turnovers fresh out of the oven. They took them back to  her office as the kitchens were too warm to stay inside comfortably, and  at them with their fingers. </span><br/><br/><span>"There  now, that's better. But I still think we should be done with reports  for the day. There's nothing urgent," he said, licking his fingertips.</span><br/><br/><span>Bitterblue  watched him for a moment too long, and then smiled. "Yes, fine. Fine!  We can be done. I have reading I wanted to do, anyway."</span><br/><br/><span>Teddy  stood, and came around her desk. He took her hand, kissing the back,  and then laughed when she pulled him into a hug, standing to meet him.  He leant in to kiss her cheek, but she turned her head and kissed him on  the mouth. His lips were warm and soft and his smile, when he finally  pulled away from her to read her face, was sweet.</span><br/><br/><span>"Oh, Lucky. You taste of apple turnovers." He smiled, and stepped back, pulling away. "I'll see you tomorrow."</span><br/><br/><span>Bitterblue was left standing in her office, the memory of his mouth on hers and his strong hands on her arms. </span></p>
