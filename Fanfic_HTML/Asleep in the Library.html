  <span>Everything  was quieter with the others gone, and Bitterblue had taken to spending  hours in the library. She had written as much to Giddon amongst all the  other minuatae of her letters, so he isn't surprised to find her there  when he arrives in Bitterblue City. He might be surprised that she's  fallen asleep at her reading table, but he isn't--not really. </span><br/><br/><span>She smiles softly when he touches her shoulder, blinking away sleep.</span><br/><br/><span>"You've fallen asleep in the library. Again."</span><br/><br/><span>"You're </span>
  <em> <span>home</span></em>
  <span>." Her smile is infectious, and he finds himself grinning back. "Oh--" she yawns, "is it late already? It's gone dark."</span><br/><br/><span>Giddon  carefully slides his arm around her and helps her to her feet. "Yes,  it's late. Po and Katsa are in their rooms already, and he told me you  were up here. We can go have dinner with them if you want."</span><br/><br/><span>Bitterblue  laughs, and catches him in a soft kiss. "I think, lord king, that they  can wait until morning." He laughs, and then lifts her in his arms to  carry her.</span><br/><br/><span>"That, lady queen, is an excellent suggestion."</span>
