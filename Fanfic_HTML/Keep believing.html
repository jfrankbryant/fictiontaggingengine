    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>There are things you don’t say in prison. Everyone knows that. The guards know it, the inmates know it, even Shadow knows it without being told. Low-Key knows it, and Shadow <em>knows</em> he does because it’s only when he’s in a particularly mischievous mood that he says them.</p><p>Shadow’s in the practice yard, doing bicep curls with the dumb-bells. Low-Key is propped up against the wall smoking a small raggedy cigarette and listening to Iceman go off on some long-winded, rambling rant about someone, or something, that screwed him over and Low-Key squints at the sky and murmurs half under his breath “Last guy who fucked me was hung like a horse.”</p><p>And then he laughs. Laughs like a rat trapped in a drain.</p><p>“Really, man?” Iceman snaps, his train of thought sufficiently derailed.</p><p>There’s a chance, Shadow knows, for Low-Key to pretend it’s a joke. He curls up the iron in his fist, counting under his breath. If Low-Key pretends it’s a joke then the conversation can go back to where it was. If he doesn’t then the words sit between them, leaden and heavy, more brazen for having been said.</p><p>Shadow has no doubt in his mind that Low-Key has indeed fucked a dude, and that said dude was indeed generously endowed. He doesn’t want to look at Low-Key because if he does, he knows he’ll start thinking about it.</p><p>“Yeah.” Low-Key answers, repeating the words again just to show how much he knows he shouldn’t be saying them, “Hung like a horse.”</p><p>Iceman’s brow furrows suspiciously, “You don’t look like a fag.”</p><p>“I owed him money.” Low-Key laughs again, laughs so much he almost doubles over. Shadow grips the iron tighter because any minute now Iceman will decide Low-Key is laughing at him, and when Iceman loses his temper things go to shit very quickly.</p><p>But instead Iceman gives a snort, and Shadow feels his heart-rate slow down just slightly, “That’s fucking nasty, man.”</p><p>“This one time,” Low-Key sounds like he’s just warming up and Shadow gives up pretending to work out, resting the dumb-bell next to him on the bench and giving a sigh, “This dude stole my mate’s hummer. Just smashed in the window and drove off in it. So we followed the fucker to Vegas and my mate, I kid you not, puts on a dress and fucking marries the guy. In Vegas.” Low-Key’s laugh is infectious and even Iceman is grinning at this one. “He’s like six foot tall and built like a ton of bricks, but he gets in a white lacy dress and they go to a chapel, and get a fucking priest to sign it off and everything.”</p><p>“Did he know?” Iceman asks, because Low-Key does this. He pulls people into the circle around his world, drawing them in, fascinated and a little disgusted. “Did the guy know he married a man?”</p><p>“He knew the next morning when he woke up to find we’d spent all his money, trashed his room, and fucked off with the hummer.”</p><p>Shadow knows that not all of Low-Key’s stories can be true. They <em>can’t</em> be. Yet somehow, he also knows he could believe them all.</p><p>“Is that true?” He asks later, when they’re back in their cell. “You really got a six-foot bodybuilder in drag to get married?”</p><p>“Not a word of a lie.” Low-Key grins at him from the bunk, “Do you want to know if the other one’s true as well?”</p><p>Shadow has been propositioned already since he’s been in prison. Some of the guys here are gay, some are desperate, it was nothing more than a hand on his thigh and it took nothing more than a look to get it withdrawn. He’s not entirely sure that’s what’s happening here. It feels more like a test, like a joke, like Low-Key will wait until Shadow’s balls-deep in him and then scoff at him for taking it seriously.</p><p>It’s all academic anyway. He knows he’ll never cheat on Laura. It’s part of the rock-hard certainty that’s keeping him sane in prison.</p><p>“I can believe you got fucked.” Shadow says, lowering himself down into his own bunk and wishing his cell-mate came with an off-switch.</p><p>“You believe I got fucked by a horse-dick?”</p><p>“Sure. Why not.”</p><p>There’s silence and Shadow wonders if the conversation is over. It seems very unlike Low-Key to finish a conversation without getting the last word in.</p><p>There’s a creak from the bed-springs as Low-Key turns over and then there it is, the final word on the subject, “You keep believing Shadow.”</p><p>At any other time, Shadow would be certain it was a masturbation joke. But the voice doesn’t sound like Low-Key’s usual voice, a grin and a smirk and a nasal southern twang. It sounds old, and empty, whispered through scarred lips and gapped teeth.</p><p>Shadow falls asleep and for the first time in a long while his sleep is dreamless.</p>
