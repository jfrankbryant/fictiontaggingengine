      <p>
  <span>“NO!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Klaus bolted upright in his bed, trembling and quickly on his way to hyperventilating. All he could think was that he needed someone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He quickly reached over to his nightstand and grabbed his phone, calling Charlie.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hello?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Char-cha-charlie?” he stuttered.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Klaus? Shit, what’s wrong, kid? Are you hurt?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Charlie said, trying not to sound panicked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not- not hurt. Can you- I can’t-” he said, crying.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hey, it’s okay, kid. Deep breaths. Where are you?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Charlie said soothingly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“House.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Okay, I’m going to be there in about 10 minutes. Is there a key hidden somewhere that I can use?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“In- in the plant- the plant left of the door,” he said, sniffling.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Okay. I’ll be there in 10 minutes. Are you going to be okay?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ye- yeah. Please be- hurry?” he whispered, stumbling over his words.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I will, promise.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Charlie said, hanging up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Klaus dropped his phone onto the floor and pulled his knees towards his chest. He was crying, and he really didn’t want to be alone. His breathing picked up again. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Shit,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he thought, </span>
  <em>
    <span>No, nonono, not right now, just had a nightmare, don’t need a panic attack right now, please.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie jogged up to the door, quickly finding the key and going inside. He was glad that he’d been here so many times before because it only took him about 2 minutes to find Klaus’ room. He knocked on the door, opening it when no one responded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Klaus?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The word seemed muffled, not real. He pulled the blankets tighter around himself, not entirely sure where he was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Klaus? Oh shit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He felt the bed dip and flinched, pushing himself flat against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, it’s just me. You called me, remember? It’s Charlie. Can I touch you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Klaus thought about it for a minute before slowly nodding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie carefully pulled the cover back and sat Klaus up, having realized that he was having some kind of a flashback or panic attack. He pulled the younger man against him and took a deep breath to steady his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Klaus, you’re okay. You’re having a panic attack. You’re in your room, you’re safe.” he murmured. “I need you to try and breathe with me, okay? In and out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I- I can’t- I need-” Klaus said breathlessly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Klaus,” he said firmly, cutting him off. “I’ve got you. Breathe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tightened his grip, holding the man as tightly to his body as he could, hoping that the technique would still help him. </span>
  <em>
    <span>The pressure helps pull me out of my head,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’d explained to Charlie back in Vietnam. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It reminds me of what’s real.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Klaus gasped in a breath, coughing and firmly latching onto Charlie’s shirt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s better, there you go,” Charlie soothed, moving a hand to firmly hold the back of Klaus’ neck and head. “You’re safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ch-Charlie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s me. What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Had a nightmare,” Klaus mumbled. “‘Bout Dave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shit, kid,” he said, running his fingers through Klaus’ hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘M sorry I woke you up, wasn’t thinking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh no you don’t, kid. You don’t get to be sorry for that. I’m glad you called me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really?” he asked in a small voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to keep his anger at everyone who’d made Klaus feel like he wasn’t worth this at bay.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really, kid. I want you to call me when you need me. Don’t ever feel bad about that,” he managed to say in a calm, but firm, voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I care, Klaus,” he explained gently. “I want you to call because I care. I don’t want you to be alone when you’re sad or scared or in pain. I want you to feel safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Thank you,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Klaus said, his breath hitching.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Always, kid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Klaus let his eyes drift shut, leaning against Charlie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Klaus, you’re gonna be sore in the morning if you fall asleep like this. D’ya wanna lay down?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Klaus let out a quiet whine, his grip on Charlie’s shirt tightening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, it’s okay. I can stay, I won’t leave until you kick me out,” Charlie soothed, tightening his grip once again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few moments later, Klaus nodded and Charlie kicked off his shoes, pushing his legs under the covers and shuffling down the headboard until he and Klaus were both lying down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There we go, I’ve gotcha,” he whispered into Klaus’ hair, and the younger man tucked his head into the crook of Charlie’s neck, getting as close as possible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Klaus mumbled, almost inaudibly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your welcome, Klaus,” he said, gently rubbing Klaus’ head. “Sleep tight.”</span>
