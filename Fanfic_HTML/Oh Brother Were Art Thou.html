</p>
<p align="left">Sustained mild head injury during descent.  Will recommend stronger fittings for lifepods upon extraction.</p>
<p align="left">Minimal food and water aboard.  Other lifepod occupant is <strong>Ross, Elliot; Liaison Officer.  </strong>Ross fortunately escaped with a habitat fabricator in his pocket.  No other tools available, but lifepod fabricator is functional.</p>
<p align="left">
  <u>Environmental Assessment: </u>
</p>
<p align="left">Pod landed in shallow oceans near Aurora crash site.  Local fauna appears docile and is abundant.  Large coral formations and marine flora are also readily accessible.</p>
<p align="left">Water immediately around Aurora's hull glows blue at night.  Suspect a major radiation leak from antimatter drives.</p>
<p align="left">Local celestial bodies include at least two moons in very low orbits.</p>

<p align="left">Low food and water.  Managed to repair emergency radio, but no contact made with other lifepods.</p>
<p align="left">Head injury appears to be healing well.  Had Elias check for signs of concussion, but none found.</p>
<p align="left">Have begun to construct underwater habitat from salvaged pieces of Aurora's hull, but will not be finished by nightfall.</p>
<p align="left">Multiple eclipse events today as both moons completed multiple orbits.  Eclipse events seemed to cause Elias considerable anxiety.  Will have to monitor his mental health more than I had planned.</p>

<p align="left">Processed food reserves depleted.  Local fauna proves edible.  Construction of basic habitation progressing.  Airlock and crew module constructed so far.</p>
<p align="left">Elias discovered first example of hostile fauna in shallow caves beneath our landing site.  Some sort of spiny fish that forms a symbiotic relationship with cave plants that concentrate sulfur from the substrate.  Fish in question fires sharp spines in all directions as a defense mechanism.  Elias sustained numerous cuts and punctures as a result of the encounter.  Immediately withdrew to habitation in case blood in the water attracted larger predators. </p>

<p align="left">Aurora's drive core deteriorating.  Have asked Elias to work on collecting materials of radiation protection suits. </p>
<p align="left">Yesterday's incident is still troubling.  The possibility of infection with water-born bacteria is extremely high, especially for Elias, as he had open wounds.  His vital signs remain normal, but I am still concerned.</p>
<p align="left">Elias discovered a mostly-intact exploration sub in a nearby debris field.  Battery is nearly flat, but serviceable.  He said he heard the computer warning about low power.  Strange that he could hear through the rubble and at a distance.  Hopefully not a sign of infection.</p>

<p align="left">Violent explosion occurred within Aurora's wreckage in the early hours of the morning.  Background radiation increasing significantly.  Managed to fabricate rad suits in time, so work outside is still progressing.</p>
<p align="left">Elias' behavior is becoming increasingly erratic.  He is more irritable and jumpy, qualities not usually found in liaison staff.  Will continue to monitor the situation, and prepare a sedative should restraining him become necessary.</p>
<p align="left">
  <u>Contact report:</u>
</p>
<p align="left">Received distress call from nearby lifepod.  Two occupants are trapped on shallow sea floor by aggressive shark-like fish.  Elias offered to stay and modify our habitation to accommodate the extra crew.  Perhaps he's simply grown irritable from the lack of privacy?  Plausible.</p>

  <em>I watch through the window as Vincent pilots our submersible away between the coral outcrops.  As much as I like the way he looks in his wetsuit, and the way his mind closes like a steel trap around problems, it's a relief to see the back of him for a few hours.  </em>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>I wait a few more minutes to be sure he's gone, then strip out of my wetsuit and relax into the shift.  The extra moon here has been making the magic itch under my skin worse than the sand and salt that's been encrusted in my hair.  Now, with the wolf on the surface again, I can relax and really get to work.  Without Vincent here I can use my full strength to move most of the debris field we've been scavenging back to the habitat.  Perhaps I'll add a crew module above water?  The noises some of these fish make has been making my skin crawl.</em>

  <em>I take a few strokes away and turn to admire my work.  With the stuff I managed to drag back today I've managed to build on two more modules, a water purifier, and a shower.  Which I am super excited about because having salt in my hair constantly was driving me up the walls. </em>

  <em>I kick back down to the airlock and let myself in.  A moment later and I'm peeling out of my wetsuit and jumping into a shower for the first time in days.  It's glorious.</em>

  <em>I step out into the room I share with Vincent a few minutes later and let myself collapse onto the bed.  A minute or two later I'm letting my claws and fur back  out with a sigh.  Vincent's been gone about two hours now, but I've probably still got time for a short nap before I've got to go back to pretending to be human again.</em>

<p align="left">I apparently collapsed upon our return from the kelp forest region, and Elias and the others had to put me to bed.  I honestly don't remember; but I did have rather strange and vivid dreams.</p>
<p align="left">The scanner that Elias managed to find just had a dead battery.  Marissa replaced it and did a quick medical scan on all of us.  Results are deeply troubling.  There are large amounts of waterborne bacteria on this planet, and all of us have been exposed to some degree.  However, despite having had his bloodstream directly exposed to these bacteria, Elias seems to have escaped major infection. </p>
<p align="left">Scans have indicated, however, that I am the most severely infected.  So far I am feeling no side effects, but this is a disturbing turn of events.  Marissa has advised that I take things easy, but that bed-rest is not necessary.</p>
<p>Decided to take it easy today, as Marin and Marissa have volunteered to help Elias investigate the nearby kelp fields. </p>

  <em>I've been trying to add a few more windows to the infirmary module so that Vincent can still at least see the outdoor grow beds if he gets too sick to actually tend them himself.  I'm still not happy that he won't let any of us stay with him, even if none of us can catch this infection from him.  It doesn't feel right, leaving him alone out here like this.  We can't even see the infirmary from our main habitat.  What if it springs a leak and he's too sick to get up and fix it?  </em>

</p><p align="left">
  <em>And then in the airlock, fuck, it was so awkward.  He couldn't get his wetsuit on properly and I had to help him.  He has really nice calf muscles, and I was trying not to stare too much, and I accidentally tripped him over on top of me.  Like an idiot.  </em>

  <em>Instead, I swim up to the top of the outcrop that overlooks the infirmary.  It's the only place I've found so far that's shallow enough to properly sit on when the tide is low.  The water here only comes up to my hips when I sit down.  I dangle my legs out over the edge and try to clear my head a bit.  I try not to think too hard about VIncent getting settled in to his new home below me.  It's... hard.  I've been thinking about him a lot recently.  I've been trying to keep things professional while we're out here, but I'm aware I have a massive crush on him and that I actually have to talk to him about it at some point.  It's just- hard.  When there's so much else going on.  And when you know that everything you say out loud is being recorded for later analysis.  </em>

</u>
</p><p align="left"><u>Medical Summary:</u>  Temperature has stabilized temporarily around 38.1 degrees average.  Dizziness now accompanied by mild nausea.  Immune response stable but significantly lowered from baseline.  Skin discoloration much advanced, now evident across entire body.  Blood vessels stand out as a greener yellow.  Eyes are also showing slight discoloration.</p><p align="left"><u>Status:</u>  Research on enzymes stalled while I wait for news from expedition.  The addition of nausea to my symptoms is unwelcome and uncomfortable.  Eli visited this morning to check on the exterior beds and get my condition report to forward to Marissa.  His obvious distress at my deteriorating condition is an excellent motivation to try and step up my research into other possible cure pathways.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
  <u>Radio Contact Report:</u>
</p><p align="left">Received word from Marin over the radio that the exploration team has discovered the cause of the Aurora's orbital hull failure.  Cause is described as a quarantine defense system consisting of some sort of ion canon located on an island about 1km away from the Aurora. </p><p align="left">Expedition team has taken steps to warn the trading vessel attempting rescue not to attempt planetary or lunar orbits until we can be absolutely certain that this defense system is deactivated. </p><p align="left">Marissa reports that she has found records of research into a cure for this infection within the facility, and will be forwarding me the information as soon as possible.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">

  <em>Working with Malaya on controlling her shift is a welcome distraction to worrying about Vincent's condition.  She's a strange contradiction: Very self aware and in control of her actions during the full moon shift, but no control over her form whatsoever. <br/>
</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I spend an hour with her just shifting back and forth until she can actually do it at will even when the moons are up (which is most of the time here).  It's nice; a familiar teaching routine.  Mom used to have me do this all the time with newly-bitten werewolves in our pack; doing it now with someone who's had twenty years to practice controlling the emotional side of herself just makes it fun.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I had to build an outdoor platform for us to practice on so we could chat without being recorded for the mission log.  I'd offer to teach her some hand to hand stuff, but since so much of the way I fight werewolves involves throwing them, I'm not sure that would be a good idea.  Who knows what you might land on out here?</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>It takes about two hours before we're hungry enough to call it quits and go back inside.  Malaya trots off to her room while I start putting something together for the fabricator to cook.  On the radio I can hear Vincent puttering around his laboratory; the clinking of beakers and tapping of his keyboard almost soothing if you forget their purpose.  Over the past two days we've been gradually fine-tuning the radios so there's almost no static, so it's almost like he's here in our habitat with me if I close my eyes.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Until I hear a muffled curse and the tinkling of breaking glass.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"You all right?"  I ask, glancing over at the receiver, as if he can see my concern through it.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Missed the table,"  he replies after a few seconds of silence.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Feeling dizzy?  You should probably eat,"  I snag my lunch from the fabricator and go to sit down next to the receiver.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"I should..."  He trails off.  I wait for him to finish, but its a good twenty seconds before he keeps going.  "This fever is making it hard to keep my thoughts straight."</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"I would make a pun about straight people here, but I'm too worried about that last statement to do it right now.  Can you do a scan for me?"</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Yeah."</em>
</p><p align="left">There's pause while I hear him get up and get something out of a locker.  His movements sound slower than usual, and he's breathing harder when he gets back from wherever he had his scanner stored.  Then there's the distinct whirring of the scanner working, followed by a soft beep.</p><p align="left">"Fever's gone up again," He says.  He sounds tired.  "It's at 39 degrees now.  Function of the hypothalamus is compromised..."  He keeps reading, and for the first time I can hear a hint of fear in his usually-steady voice.</p><p align="left">Malaya wanders back in a moment later, looking about as worried as I feel. </p><p align="left">"Vince, you should be in bed," she says quietly when he's finished listing symptoms.  He makes a frustrated sound, but we can hear him putting things away so I guess that's a victory. </p><p align="left">It doesn't feel like one.</p><p align="left">

</p><p align="left"><u>Medical status:</u>  Temperature elevated again to 39 degrees average.  Lymphatic system infection spreading, with skin irritation.  Febrile neutropenia is indicated.  Recommended treatment with antibiotics ineffective.  White count decreasing again.  Dizziness and disorientation more pronounced, with worsening nausea.  <u> </u></p><p align="left"><u>Research Log:</u> Further investigation of available fauna has not yielded any additional cure pathways besides those already identified.  Research materials recovered by Marissa indicate that the source of the enzyme in question is a rare, leviathan-class species of fauna.  Several specimens were apparently retained for research, but the location is not given in the material I have on hand. </p><p align="left"><u>Status:</u> Had to abandon laboratory research in the early afternoon as hand-eye coordination deteriorated.  I've retreated to bed with the notes that Marissa forwarded me, although there was not much detail provided in them. </p><p align="left">Have had to get up several times during the afternoon to vomit.  Samples retained for later analysis are an unnatural fluorescent yellow-green color.  Blood samples have a similar tinge to them.</p><p align="left">Have been in conversation with Eli and Marissa about a plan for going forward.  If my fever has not gone down by morning then Eli and Mal will be admitted to the quarantine facility in shifts to keep an eye on my condition and take preventative steps as necessary. </p><p align="left"> </p>

  <em>Malaya and I had a long conversation with Marissa yesterday about giving him the bite.  She wants to give them a chance to find a normal cure and return, but he's getting so sick that we'll have to be ready to act at a moment's notice.  The point of no return is 41 degrees.  We're all certain he'll get there at this point (his immune system is essentially non-functioning), but it's a question of how long.  </em>

  <em>I run a hand through his sweaty hair, pushing it back off his forehead idly.  It's funny how despite how much I like him this doesn't feel intimate.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>It's not really funny though.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>It's about an hour before he starts to wake up; his breath picking up and his fingers twitching before he jerks awake.  I hand him the scanner when he asks for it, and watch as he collapses back against the pillows to read the results.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Fuck."  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>He sounds defeated, which is somehow the worst part.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Even if they got back here with the cure right now I don't think I'm going to make it,"  He croaks.  "It's wrecking my liver now."</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I reach out, but stop short of taking his hand when I remember the cysts.  "Does it hurt a lot?"</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Sort of?"  His voice is going now, too.  "My nervous system is all screwed up, so I can feel it, but it's like it's happening to someone else."</em>

  <em>Vincent starts having a seizure around 2am.  He's been mostly unconscious since the late afternoon according to Mal.  He woke up briefly when we traded shifts at midnight, but then he was out like a light again.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>We've been scanning him every minute or so since around 8pm, when he complained of abdominal pain.  I've been on tender hooks for the past half hour, as several of his internal organs have neared failure.   </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I'm on him in an instant when I realize what's happening.  Before I can even think about it I'm letting myself shift and sinking my teeth into the first available flesh, which happens to be his right side, just above the hip.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>The blood that wells up in my mouth tastes and smells wrong, but I hang on for at least ten seconds to make sure the magic takes.  Vaguely, I hear Malaya shouting over the radio, demanding to know what's going on.  Underneath that, the choked-off, horrible sounds that Vincent's making as his muscles spasm uncontrollably.  There's the sharp snap of one of his bones breaking as he hits it on something, and I squeeze my eyes closed and hope that we didn't wait too long.   </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I feel sick myself when I finally let go and sit up; and see the blood welling sluggishly from the wound on his side.  It's not even red anymore, but the same luminous yellow-green as the cysts on his hands.  His eyes, when they open, are the same color, although it's already beginning to fade.  A quick scan confirms that his vitals are already stabilizing, although there's just so much damage it might be a while before he can get up.  His wrist is broken from hitting the headboard, and he bit the hell out of his tongue, if the blood on his teeth is anything to go by.<br/>

  <em>Malaya is still on the radio, asking me what the fuck just happened.  I need to answer her.  Shit.</em>

  <em>"Yeah.  The scanner says his vital signs are stabilizing, and he's already stopped bleeding."</em>

  <em>"Good.  Are you okay to stay there until the sun comes up?  I'm gonna catch a quick nap before I come over."</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Roger that.  He'll probably still be in bed, but he should be a lot better by then."</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Mal signs off, and then it's just the two of us in a bed that is covered in blood and other gross stuff.  Ugh.</em>

  <em>"Do you think you can manage a chair for a minute while I take care of the bed?"  I ask him.</em>

  <em>I get a nod, so I carefully scoop him up and deposit him of the swivel chair I've parked next to the bed.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"I'm just gonna deconstruct this one and make you a fresh one, okay?"  He makes a quiet noise of assent as I whip out the habitat fabricator and zap the gross bed away.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Okay, I'm done.  Back to bed," I whisper a moment later when his fresh bed is in place.  He grumbles a bit incoherently when I move him, which is kind of adorable, but settles right down when he's under the covers.  Within a minute he's sleeping properly, his breathing evening out and deepening as the magic works to put his lungs back together.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I wait a few minutes to make sure he's really asleep, then quietly sit down within easy reaching distance.  It's finally hitting me that he's done getting worse, and it's a little hard not to grin like an idiot.</em>

</p><p align="left">Received a message from the trading vessel that responded to our original distress call.  They report that they do not have the supplies to loiter in this system for much longer, and will have to depart.  However, they have called both Alterra and the government office with jurisdiction in this sector, and have managed to get the local life-saving organization to dispatch a corvette to take their place.  They say they will remain for at least two more days before departing, in case we can get the orbital defenses disengaged by then.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">

  <em>Things I have learned about Vincent since yesterday include:</em>
</p><ol>
<li><em>He speaks four languages!  English, Tagalog, Latin, and Italian.  He learned Tagalog from his mom, and took Latin in high school and college because it's useful for botany.  Italian he picked up on the side while studying Latin.  I really only speak English well about 95% of the time, and my Hebrew is terrible.</em></li>
<li><em>He really likes holding hands, and gets adorably frustrated whenever he has to pick between letting go or asking me to grab stuff for him.</em></li>
<li><em>He keeps track of how many bad werewolf puns he can get away with before Malaya realizes what he's doing.  His record is 23.  He will probably never beat that in my presence because I have no self control when it comes to werewolf jokes.</em></li>
<li><em>HE LOOKS REALLY UNFAIRLY CUTE WITH HIS EXTRA-POINTY WEREWOLF CANINES!</em></li>
<li><em>He once won two first prize awards in the same Michigan state fair.  One for the best cabbage, and one for a butter and marzipan sculpture of that cabbage.</em></li>
<li><em>He's never been on a date before and is annoyed that he won't get to experience one until after we get back to Earth.<br/> </em></li>
<li><em>He's almost suspiciously excited to learn more about werewolf fighting.  I'm sure he's an expert in like, five different martial arts and is just looking forward to throwing me around like a rag-doll.  Whatever.  I'm into it.</em></li>
</ol><p>
  <em>Right now we're sitting on his bed working on shifting, since he's gotta have it down by the time we get out of here.  He's actually pretty good at it; which I guess isn't a surprise considering how good he is at so many random things. <br/> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Eventually practicing turns into chatting while sprawled over the bed half-shifted.  Or rather, me talking and Vincent putting in a word or two when he feels like it.  He's playing with my fingers, either enjoying the physical contact or cataloging their features for later study.  It's kinda hard to tell.  He's much more tactile than I was expecting, given how outwardly reserved he is.  I like it though.  </em>

  <em>He's nearly out!  Which I'm super excited about; not just because it means he'll be around more, but because it means we can finally do things like maybe kissing!  Which we agreed was probably a bad idea while he was still in quarantine and didn't have a plausible excuse for getting better.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>So there's a spring in my step as I swing open the airlock door back at the main habitat.  </em>

  <em>Until I see Marin and Marisa waiting for me with matching evil grins on their faces.  Which can't mean anything good.</em>

  <em>"Guys? What's up-" I jump as the door slams behind me; and they both cackle.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Guess who's got to be vaccinated before he gets to snog his boyfriend?"  Marisa sing-songs at me, producing a syringe from behind her back.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Um-"  I start backing up.  Needles are NOT my thing.  At all.  Marin practically had to wrestle me to the ground so I'd get my shots when I first got assigned off-world.  </em>

  <em>I keep backing up until I hear someone clearing their throat behind me.  It's Malaya.  Who is currently blocking my escape route.  Traitor.  I sneak a glance over my shoulder to see if I can possibly get around her, and Marin takes the opportunity to pounce.</em>

  <em>"NOOOOOOOOO!"  She's got me pinned in a flash.  Damn her superior muscle mass!</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Come on Eli; it's time for your cooties shot!"  </em>

  <em>"Oh my god you guys are the worst,"  I moan in what I hope is a piteous manner as Marin rolls up my sleeve.  Oh fuck.  "Mal, if I don't survive, tell Vincent I thought his butt was cute!"</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"How is he so bad at this?"  Mal asks as I do my best not to watch Marisa swabbing my arm with alcohol and getting the needle ready.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"I'm not sure.  Sara said she had to practically have him sedated when she had to get him vaccinated for school as a kid,"  Marin says conversationally.  I squeeze my eyes closed as I feel Marisa change her grip to give me the shot, and do my best to hold still and not start sobbing like a baby when the needle pushes into my skin.  Malaya awkwardly pats me on the head until it's over, and Marin lets me slump to the floor and take a second to get my breathing under control.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"All done, kiddo!"  Marisa chirps from where she's dropping the needle into the bio-hazard bin.  "If I had any temporary tattoos you'd be getting one right now!  Maybe when we get back to Earth I'll tell your mom to get you an ice cream!"</em>

  <u>Quarantine Supplemental Log:</u>
</p><p align="left">Malaya came by this afternoon to check up on me.  We drank terrible synthetic coffee and sat in the observatory watching the fish.  It was probably the most relaxing thing I've had time for since before the Aurora went down.  As interesting as it's been cataloging flora and fauna in a first-contact situation, I'm ready to go home take a real shower and sleep in my own bed again.  And see a therapist; because I have no doubt that this whole experience will be a massive burden on my mental health once it's over.  We haven't really had time to process the fact that of the 135 crew on the Aurora, only six of us appear to have survived. </p><p align="left">I've split most of the day between monitoring the progress of the vaccine in my system (<strong>See attached documents for quarter-hourly summary of vaccine effects), </strong>and preparing my samples and other belongings for transfer back to the main habitat.  Malaya brought me a new wetsuit the others apparently found while searching through the wreckage of the Aurora, and I've taken a few minutes to fabricate a new buoyancy control vest, air tank, and regulator. </p><p align="left">Elias, Malaya, and I will work on deconstructing the quarantine habitat while the others go and check on their egg project.  Company policy states that all material collected during first-encounter scenarios is company property; so we'll need to bring back everything we've fabricated to avoid massive fines and/or employment termination.  Because of the risk of infection, we're going to have to deconstruct everything we've fabricated to the atomic level (except for organic samples, which will be sealed for transport).  We'll undoubtedly be billed by the local life-saving station for tying up their assets for an extended period; but considering the value of the samples we will be retrieving, I suspect Alterra will be willing to cover those fees for us. </p><p align="left">Malaya has informed me that Marisa was able to fabricate enough of the experimental vaccine to inoculate all of us against the bacteria causing the infection; and that Elias had to be restrained before he would allow Marisa to administer it, due to a fear of needles.  I wonder if he is aware of how many injections and blood tests we will have to undergo as part of the environmental decontamination process?  Hopefully sedation will not be necessary.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">

<li>Trading vessel Sunbeam passed along a message from the incoming corvette.  They are one day out from this system, and should be on station by tomorrow night.  The have also (thankfully) acknowledged our instructions not to approach planetary or lunar orbits until we send word that it is safe to do so.  Sunbeam's captain restated his intention to remain on station for one more day, or until the arrival of the extraction team.</li>

<li>Also had brief radio contact with Alterra corporate headquarters.  They attempted to send us schematics for an atmospheric escape rocket, but the technician in question sent us the departmental lunch order sheet instead of the blueprints.  Recommend disciplinary action, and that in future vital plans like these are carried in secure locations aboard exploration ships.</li>

</p><p align="left">
  <em>"I think I'm gonna get a head start on taking the quarantine habitat apart," Mal says after a minute, turning toward the airlock. "That way I don't have to listen to you and Vince getting... acquainted."<br/> </em>

  <em>She slams the airlock door shut behind her, and I'm left standing in the middle of the lab for a second before my brain manages to communicate to my feet that I should go find Vincent.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>He's asleep in our room when I get there; his wetsuit exchanged for a pair of what looks like my pants, and a loose-fitting shirt, his hair still wet from the shower.  I can feel myself smiling at the way he's got his face buried in my pillow.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Actually, a nap with Vincent sounds like a pretty good idea right now...</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>As quietly as I can, I slip out of my own wetsuit and sneak into the shower to rinse off the salt water.  Freshly clean, I grab a spare pair of pants and a shirt from my locker and go to join him on the bed.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>He makes a soft noise as the mattress dips, and rolls over onto his side; cracking an eye open to see who's disturbing his nap.  When he realizes it's me, he makes another, more pleased-sounding noise and flops onto his back invitingly, his eyes opening the rest of the way.  "All done?"  He asks; his voice still sleep-heavy from his nap.  He reaches out to grab the front of my shirt and pull me closer until I'm close to falling over on top of him.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Yeah.  Mal's gone out, as well."  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Cool."  He's still got his hand tangled in the wide collar of my shirt, and the brush of his knuckles against my collarbone makes me feel like there's a big bubble of helium in my chest lifting me up towards the ceiling.  "Is this the part where we make out?"</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I can feel my heart skip a beat.  "It can be."</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Hmmm."  He closes his eyes for a moment.  "I wish we had toothpaste.  It's going to taste like fish."</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"You're totally right, but I still really want to kiss you."  Although the idea of our first kiss tasting like fish-breath is not particularly appealing. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"What if we just avoid the mouth... area?"  He raises an eyebrow quizzically.  "That's a think people do, right?"</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Oh.  "Yeah.  I can do that.  I can totally do that." I'm totally gonna do that. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I lean my head down and brush my lips against his forehead.  His hair tickles the end of my nose, and I have to fight back a sneeze; but it's totally worth it for the little sigh he lets out, and thee way his hand tugs me closer by my shirtfront until we're pressed together.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>He tilts his head, and it's my turn to make a noise as his lips brush against the underside of my jaw.  Less a kiss and more a light touch of skin against skin.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I crane my head down to see his face; flushed slightly red with little smiling creases showing at the corners of his eyes that I can't resist pressing another kiss to.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>We go back and forth like that for a while, exchanging light brushes of lips against skin, until we're pressed together; one of his large hands a burning weight across my lower back where my shirt has ridden up, the other still anchored in my shirt's collar, pulling me down on top of him.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Is this working for you?"  I ask quietly when we take a moment to breathe.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>He takes a moment to think; a very Vincent thing to do even in a moment like this one.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Yeah."  He's actually smiling.  It feels like my heart is trying to kick a hole in my rib cage.  "You smell nice.  I mean, a little sweaty; but still nice."</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Thank you?"</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>He rolls his eyes.  "It means that my brain is responding to the AND pheromone in your sweat as a sexual stimuli, and activating the anterior hypothalamus; which, by the way, is not a reaction observed in heterosexual men."</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Oh.  Cool."  Curious, I lean down and run my nose along the curve of his jaw, and making him sneeze when my hair tickles his nose.  "You smell nice too," I say, feeling my face heat up even more at the words.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I'm suddenly exceedingly glad that we're alone, because I don't think Marisa would ever let me live it down if she'd heard that.  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>A small crease forms between his eyebrows.  "Why do you look so embarrassed?  It's just basic neurology.  Stimulus causes response.  If the smell of your partner induces a positive response in the brain, then it's a good smell."</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>"Please tell that to Marisa when she inevitably hears about this and starts teasing me about it?"  I mumble, pressing my lips to his forehead again.  </em>

  <em>Right now we're sitting on top of the crew capsule enjoying the last sunset we'll see here.  Malaya's sitting a little ways away from us recording it on her datapad while she and Charlene talk quietly.  Marisa and Marin went for a last evening swim to take pictures of the bio-luminescent corals.  Beneath us the capsule rocks gently on the swells.   </em>

</p><p>I made a couple of other sets that didn't get used, but which were fun to build, including one right the heck up the side of a mountain that got left out of the story because there was no way that they were ever going to get sick Vincent up there.</p><p>I also used a reference image from Shawn herself for the bedroom scene in chapter 4.  Linked <a href="http://shawnlenore.tumblr.com/post/168162715699/drawing-a-webcomic-means-you-get-to-smoosh-your" rel="nofollow">here!</a></p><p> </p><p>Research Stuff!</p><p>
