    <h2 class="toc-heading">Grandpa</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Klaus was scared of ghosts.</p>
<p>He was scared of the screaming and blood and words and everything.</p>
<p>He wanted dad to understand.</p>
<p>He was cursed, had to be.</p>
<p>There was one ghost though who just didn’t want to be alone.</p>
<p>The man was called Grandpa, or Grandad, and he was a friend.</p>
<p>The old man didn't scare him, not at first and not ever. </p>
<p>Reginald wasn't a father or a grandfather or anything other than a monster, the night in the mausoleum had taught him this. </p>
<p>He'd given up the hope that he'd ever comfort him or apologize.</p>
<p>That's when granddad showed up.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Grandpa was a small frail looking old man with hands that were gentle and slow.</p>
<p>His withered face was wrinkled and he had laugh lines, he was always laughing at something.</p>
<p>Offering klaus a piece of candy from the dish on dad's desk when he wasn't home.</p>
<p>Going for walks with him when Klaus would sneak out.</p>
<p>Regaling him in tales of his life and his children and his still living wife.</p>
<p>Klaus liked these ones the most and had met her a few times before.</p>
<p>She didn't know how the strange, kind little boy was that brought her flowers once a month was, but she always told him she loved him and thanked him and offered him sweets.</p>
<p>Which Klaus accepted happily</p>
<p>The old man's picture was on the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>She was old and grey but had been a beautiful, spiteful woman in her youth. </p>
<p>According to grandpa, he couldn't keep up with her most of the time and let her do what made her happy.</p>
<p>Working and knitting and adventures in their old beaten up car on the weekends.</p>
<p>They had children, but none of them were in the area, all of them out state. </p>
<p>Klaus would send out small presents picked out by the old man to them, signed dad. </p>
<p>He liked to think it made him more of a hero than his powers did.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>"Who are you talking to, Klaus?"</p>
<p>"Grandpa."</p>
<p>"we don't have grandparents..."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"Okay?" </p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"Whatever...weirdo..." Diego mumbled walking away, his brother’s powers never made sense. Even at 10, when he should have been able to.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There was a storm brewing outside, the branches and wind scraping the house made it impossible to sleep.</p>
<p>How did siblings didn't care was beyond him.</p>
<p>"Grandpa, I'm scared."</p>
<p>The old man in the corner chuckled and patted the floor next to him, as if he'd been waiting.</p>
<p>"Come and sit with me child. It'll calm you down."</p>
<p>Klaus took the blankets and pillows to the corner and laid down beside him.</p>
<p>The storm outside raged on. </p>
<p>"Do you want me to tell you a story?" </p>
<p>"Yes please."</p>
<p>"How does another army story sound?"</p>
<p>"Sounds great."</p>
<p>"We'd just finished basic training when..."</p>
<p>Klaus was asleep before the middle of the story, snoring lightly as the storm had been forgotten.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>"She's gone, Klaus."</p>
<p>Klaus was now 19, still occasionally seeing grandpa when he wasn't high. It was a rare moment.</p>
<p>He had seen the obituary, it was in his coat pocket. </p>
<p>He didn't want to get rid of it ever.</p>
<p>"I have to go."</p>
<p>"I know..."</p>
<p>"You'll be okay?"</p>
<p>"I will. I promise."</p>
<p>"Take care of yourself, my boy. You're in for a great life."</p>
<p>"Tell her I said hi." </p>
<p>"I will. Goodbye, klaus."</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Granddad. Take care."</p>
<p>“You too, my boy.”</p>
<p>And just like that, he was gone.</p>
<p>Klaus was alone and sobbing in the middle of dirty alleyway.</p>
<p>He was scared.</p>
<p>But he was happy.</p>
<p>They'd found each other.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There were days when he would visit the graves of Walter and Beatrice Right, questioning why him.</p>
<p>There were other days when he was incredibly happy that they were together in eternity wherever they ended up.</p>
<p>Never knowing the answers was the hardest part of being the man he was.</p>
<p>But knowing that he had had the pleasure of meeting them and having Walter there for all of those years...</p>
<p>It made him hopeful that he was lovable. </p>
<p>Today, however, he was visiting with flowers and last words.</p>
<p>He didn't want to have to come back here with guilty conscience. </p>
<p>He brought sunflowers for them, their favorite and the flowers from the story of their wedding.</p>
<p>It was sunny outside, blue skies and good omens.</p>
<p>God, he sounded like he was tripping. </p>
<p>But he wasn't.</p>
<p>His head was clear.</p>
<p>Kneeling down on the familiar grass in front of their headstones, he let out a chuckle.</p>
<p>"I wanted to say thank you for everything... You did so much. And for that I am so grateful. I hope wherever you ended up is nice and that it's treating you both well. Thank you and this is it, I guess. I'm not coming back after today. So this is goodbye for now, thank you."</p>
<p>He walked back and caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of his eye, it made him turn and watch.</p>
<p>A young couple, both dressed straight out of the 40's were pushing an old looking pram. </p>
<p>The wife had black wavy hair and the old man had the same twinkling blue eyes.</p>
<p>The young man had noticed him and smiled ear to ear.</p>
<p>He lifted his hand to Klaus in a little wave before following her.</p>
<p>"Thank you." Klaus mumbled, leaving the cemetery one last time.</p>
<p>They were alright. </p>
<p>They were together.</p>
<p>And to Klaus, that was all that mattered.</p>
