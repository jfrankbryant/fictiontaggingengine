      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>"You aren't the only one with a child to protect." An Everlark Modern Day AU about becoming a blended family.</p><p>Enjoy, you ingrates!</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello there! Thank you for reading.</p><p>A blended family is formed when people marry while still raising children from previous relationships. Think Jada &amp; Will, Ashton &amp; Demi, etc.</p><p>I wrote this after reading a few Daddy!Peeta fics. I fell in love with the idea of Peeta as a father. And so this is an Everlark modern day AU story about how complicated, messy, and yet still beautiful becoming a blended family can be.</p><p>Thank you to Lauralulubee for playing beta for me with this prologue.</p><p>I own nothing. Characters by Suzanne Collins, quotes from music by Kendrick Lamar.</p><p>I hope you enjoy it.</p></blockquote>

I ultimately took it out, because I've never actually heard rhyming slang used in conversation (except by Don Cheadle in Ocean's Eleven) and I wasn't sure how natural it sounded. So if you're British and this offends, I'm sorry. Thats not my intent.</p><p>Let me know what you think.</p><p>His thumb strokes the back of my hand as he takes a deep calming breath. Gale's eyes darken and I hold his gaze as his lips part. </p><p>"Leave it out," Rory says. </p><p>Gale turns to face Rory. "Rue's up the apples and pears all ballistic. And my trouble and strife is telling pork pies about this...dental flosser." He gestures towards Peeta.</p><p>"Gale," I caution. Prim rolls her eyes. She and I especially hate when Gale and Rory code switch like this. Haven't they figured out that we can still understand them? Mostly. "I ain't your wife."</p><p>"You don't have a fork and knife. Now, leave it out, or you'll get me in right Barney." He hooks a thumb at Prim. "You and Rue will rabbit and pork, mashed potatoes," Rory sighs.</p><p>Peeta wears a confused expression as his eyes drift to the mashed potatoes on the table.</p><p>"What are they talking about, Daddy?" DJ says quietly. Peeta only shakes his head at her, indicating that he does not wish to tell her. But I know it's because he doesn't know, himself.</p><p>I make a show of throwing my hands up.

I pulled it out of my trash after getting over a dozen messages inside of a few hours of posting the last chapter asking about Peeta &amp; Gale's conversation and what Peeta was doing all day. I sent it to my beta, lauralulubee, and we agree that it does nothing to move the plot forward (and we are already at 100K words, and still deep in the plot). But, as special treat, and since I truly value your feedback and continued enjoyment of this story, we fixed it up a little and I'm posting it just for you.</p><p>Thank you again for your amazing feedback, sharing your personal stories, and most of all for being polite. I can't tell you how far a kind message goes in motivating me in writing this fic. Keep the reviews coming!</p></blockquote>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>A note about giving birth:</p><p>I've only done it once. I was 27, in great shape before I got pregnant (seriously, I was good to go. See my body paint photo on tumblr taken 4 months before I got pregnant. I've never looked better!) and it took 27 hours. My water broke before my contractions were close (which doesn't happen often, but it does happen.)</p><p>I haven't given birth to twins so I had some help with this. Katniss has a fairly uncomplicated birth. Both of her babies were head down, which is not always the case. I've read so many birth stories on the bump, theunnecesarean, and babycenter where women give birth vaginally to the first twin, but then had a c-section for the second due to position. It's tough. The second baby is anything but easy.</p><p>In case you missed it: Katniss is 28 years old, and this is her second pregnancy and second birth. I gave her about 12 hours of labor, with 22 minutes of pushing and 19 minutes between twins. Her water didn't break until her contractions were two minutes apart. Her complications were the second baby drifting back up (her doctors may have suggested a c section, but she wasn't in a hospital) and tearing on the second baby. The babies themselves had "normal" birth weights and decent Apgar scores. </p><p>Anyway if you want to know more about giving birth to multiples, I'd start here:</p><p>Here's what the uva medical center thinks about C-sections:<br/>uvahealth dot com/services/womens-health/conditions-treatments/14798</p><p>Also UVA's stats:<br/>theunnecesarean dot com/blog/2010/12/15/virginia-cesarean-rates-by-hospital-2006 dot html#sthash dot oleHVd5f dot dpbs</p><p>And info on multiple births:<br/>americanpregnancy dot org/multiples/complications dot htm</p><p>And read this woman's birth story:<br/>amongstlovelythings dot com/2013/08/welcoming-our-twins-my-birth-story dot html</p><p>And if medical journals are your thing I suggest the following:</p><p>A Randomized Trial of Planned Cesarean or Vaginal Delivery for Twin Pregnancy<br/>N Engl J Med 2013; 369:1295-1305 October 3, 2013DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1214939</p><p>Method of delivery of the nonvertex second twin: a community hospital experience.<br/>AuthorsSmith SJ, et al.<br/>J Matern Fetal Med. 1997 May-Jun;6(3):146-50.</p></blockquote>

I'm sorry. If you haven't had any kids, I can assure you the first few postpartum weeks can be just like this (and for me they were worse!). Anyway, that's my disclaimer...</p></blockquote>

Check out the Blend Holiday Outtake I wrote for Prompts in Panem. I started with Katniss and Peeta's first Christmas, and will upload a second chapter about celebrating New Years with the boys as toddlers in the next day or so. So go check that out if you're needing your fix of Ash and Arch growing up, because were about to jump ahead a bit :)</p><p>Also, the holiday fic exchange brought us 37 new fics. I'd recommend Glühwein written by the fabulous MockingJayFlyingFree, Star Crossed Killers by the talented Lauralulubee, and Christmas TV written by yours truly.</p><p>I also updated Rerun, and wrote a New Years fic. Everything is posted here. Like I said. I've been busy!</p><p>Anyway, we're in the home stretch, this chapter begins the final conflict.

      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>When I started this story in July of 2013, I never imagined it would be such an amazing experience. Here we are at the end, and I want to thank you all for going on this ride with me.</p><p>I have a few quick announcements before we dive in:</p><p>S2SL, the charity effort organized by StreetLightLove1 was a success, and raised over $4600 for cancer research. So, Congrats to everyone who donated! And for those of you who couldn't, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10150943/1/I-Kissed-A-Girl"> I Kissed A Girl </a>, my contribution, will be posted on June 1st. If you've enjoyed my smut in Blend, you're going to love IKAG, which is very smutty :) The teaser is already up, so be sure to follow the story, and you will be alerted once I start to post it. There are 5 chapters, and you're not going to want to miss any of them. It's an Everlark story, but Anniss is central to the plot. So, if girl on girl isn't your thing, there's no need to call me a dyke. Simply, do not read it.</p><p>Please be sure to subcribe to<a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1087921/chapters/2189155"> Blend: Holiday Outtake</a>. There are already two outtakes posted there, and if you haven't read at least the first one, you might be a little confused reading this chapter. Each outtake follows a holiday - so far Christmas and New Years, and I suspect I'll add more once I start to miss DJ... Damn, I'm really gonna miss DJ.</p><p>MockingJayFlyingFree and I are coauthoring two stories: <a> Absinthe </a>, which is a sequel to her Glühwein and <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1214113/chapters/2483626">When I Go </a>, which is a sequel to my Christmas TV.

I don't know which of you requested it of her, but thank you so much! And thank you to Everlart of course for sharing her talent. You can catch up with her on tumblr and see all of the fic and canon inspired drawings she's made.</p><p>Thank you to all of the ladies who beta'd and preread parts of this story for me, Lauralulubee, Chelzie, and MockingJayFlyingFree.
