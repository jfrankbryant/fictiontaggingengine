      <p>"I thought ... " Door bit her lip.</p><p>The Marquis looked thoughtful for the briefest of moments, then shrugged and said, "Quite."</p><p>Richard didn't know if he was expected to play any part in this conversation. Nobody appeared to be looking at him as if he was, though. He hoped that was a good sign.</p><p>"I thought that if anyone in our company was a traitor, it would be more likely to be you than Hunter."</p><p>The Marquis's expression was faintly bored. "Not a speck of suspicion on Richard. Naturally."</p><p>"Naturally," Door said, and even though nobody was staring at him, Richard still felt he might make a contribution here.</p><p>"Why? Because I'm an idiot?"</p><p>"Obviously," the Marquis said. "Treason requires a certain amount of intelligence, after all. An inkling of good sense. A keen survival instinct, or something close enough to it to be mistaken for one."</p><p>Richard thought back on when he'd first met Door. On how callous he'd thought Jessica had acted and spoken, not wanting to be inconvenienced helping a complete stranger.</p><p>"Thank you," he said.</p><p>The Marquis wrinkled his nose at him. "Mere flattery with a drop of truth in it. A small favor, at best."</p><p>"None, I would say," Door said, and there was a hint of steel in her voice.</p><p>The Marquis shrugged, again. "For not betraying you, then? For faithful services rendered?"</p><p>"That's a bit rich, don't you think?" Richard asked. Both Door and the Marquis turned to him. He remembered how he'd always felt uncomfortable being the centre of attention.</p><p>"As I was saying," said the Marquis. "Entirely above suspicion. Naturally."</p><p>"Still," Door said, and it dawned on Richard a bit belatedly that what she was getting at here was an apology. An indirect one, true - one that did not involve any additional favors owed, but still an apology.</p><p>The Marquis coughed delicately. "As I was also saying, when it comes to treason, only an idiot should be above suspicion. I should like to believe you have a somewhat firmer grasp on reality than to misjudge my person to such an extreme degree."</p><p>"I did it, too," Richard said. He'd doubted, at least. Wondered.</p><p>"Did what?" the Marquis inquired.</p><p>"Suspect you," said Richard and then, because he wasn't Door, "Sorry."</p><p>The Marquis looked slightly pained. "Do do it again. You might be right next time - for all the good that will do you. Still, better to die knowing you were right than simply surprised, isn't it?"</p><p>"Better not to die at all, I'd say."</p><p>"You would, yes." The Marquis sighed.</p><p>"And I was wrong," Richard went on.</p><p>"Generally speaking, most assuredly. You should get used to the experience."</p><p>"You're not the type who betrays people," Richard said.</p><p>Door must have realized it, too, he thought. She'd never have said it out loud, though.</p><p>"Oh, now you're just being offensive." The Marquis studied his nails. "I'm exactly the type of person who betrays people. By way of proof, might I offer the observation that I have, in fact, betrayed quite a number of people? I could give you their names, if you wish, but seeing as how they're all dead, I fear that particular information would do you little good."</p><p>"You never would have betrayed Door," Richard said, because he was sure of that much, at least. "Or me."</p><p>The Marquis looked as if someone in muddy boots had stepped on his toes which had been covered in freshly cleaned shoes.</p><p>"It would hardly have done your reputation any good if word had gotten out that you had double-crossed someone you owed a favor to," said Door.</p><p>"Ah." The Marquis smiled thinly. "My unblemished reputation."</p><p>Neither of them seemed to be in any hurry to mention that while Door and her family had been owed a favor, Richard most definitely had not been.</p><p>"Well, it is true that there are certain difficulties involved in collecting favors from the dead," said the Marquis. "The thing is not utterly impossible, naturally - still, one does prefer the easier way. On this note, I hope we may all part in happy agreement. People to see, places to do."</p><p>"We're your friends," Richard said. "You don't betray your friends."</p><p>"If I were to betray you, I shouldn't hold it against you were you to consider it less than the act of a friend," the Marquis said. "A certain amount of hurt feelings in such cases seems natural, alas. I am not speaking from any personal experience, naturally, but one can imagine."</p><p>"Richard," Door said, softly.</p><p>She didn't remind Richard the least bit of Jessica. Door and Jessica were very different persons.</p><p>He had cared for them both, or thought he did, though; they would always have that much in common. That, and the way both Jessica and Door had spent most their lives living in worlds quite different from Richard's own.</p><p>With Jessica, the differences might have been less clear, less obvious from the outside, but Richard had been there. He knew how much like a stranger he had felt, a lot of the time.</p><p>In a way, he supposed that it should perhaps surprise him how it bothered far less him when it was Door and Door's world that seemed so alien to him.</p><p>"I'm just saying that you should feel free to come by for a cup of tea or something," Richard said. "When you've got the time. Don't be a stranger."</p><p>The Marquis grimaced. "And I am to provide the biscuits, I assume?"</p><p>"Do," Door said. "Fair is fair, after all."</p><p>"Oh, very well," said the Marquis. "I'll think about it."</p>
