    <h1>A Good Day's Work: Leaving</h1>
    <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="http://archiveofourown.org/users/roguefaerie/pseuds/roguefaerie">roguefaerie</a></div>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>A good day's work, leaving...<br/>Pack it all in, no time to remember....</p><p>In which Technical Boy is a piece of crap.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This is an interesting turn of events that wasn't really planned by the author because reasons. The things that happen when you just like smart Dean....</p><p>After finishing Of Dreams and Demons (enjoy), a sort of unintended Big Bang from 2008-2011, this is the author's new happy place. So there will be a lot of these small pieces of 'verse, sort of linear, and I have a vague plan but no outline, so...brace yourselves. lol. I hope you are enjoying it.</p><p>This series has moderated comments due to several elements in the subject matter.</p><p>Adding crossover bits as I go, so no characters from Gabriel (2007) yet, but dammit, y'all should watch that movie, so I'm tagging it and eventually there will be characters from it in the AG/SPN universe. They're so much better written than how this was handled in SPN that I can barely contain myself about it.</p><p>Posting all chapters in one fic (the first) for those who prefer long fic. But this is a chapter of a longer series in which Dean and Shadow are LGBT. Because I can.</p></blockquote>

    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Your eyes dart between Shadow and the person who is suddenly in your living room.</p><p>The person who just-- Who just--</p><p>Called you a boy.</p><p>
  <em>Tinker Bell. Tinker Bell. Tinker Bell. Not a boy. Not a boy. Not a boy.</em>
</p><p>“Listen, you asshole. You don’t get  to come around here. You definitely don’t get to come around here and hurt my friend--my best friend,” Shadow is growling.</p><p>Wait. What?</p><p>Also, Shadow is gently bracing you with one hand.</p><p>Cool. Okay. This is fine. Sort of. Sort of fine. Okay.</p><p>You can’t remember telling Shadow--well--enough, but you guess he knows. You guess he knows.</p><p> </p><p>Shadow also seems to know who this is.</p><p>“We told you, Shadow, one day the war would be waged.”</p><p>“And? You expect me to be impressed? You little shit.”</p><p>“Well, I do have to say, Dean here’s been doing us a pretty significant solid. All that tech work. So pretty.”</p><p>“Shut up!” you manage. “Shut up, you motherfucking <em>asshole</em>. This is my house and you don’t get to talk to me like that.”</p><p>And the world warps.</p><p>Odin. Odin Odin. You are Odin’s own.</p><p>Odin!</p><p>You need his presence here, even if only in your mind.</p><p>The world is still warping and you feel sick.</p><p>“We will delete you!” the asshole in your living room is screaming, but it is a multitude of voices and they’re all screaming at you. “You willl comply or we will delete you!”</p><p>Shadow is grabbing you by the shoulder. “We gotta get out of here, it’s not safe. You’re okay but this place isn’t safe anymore. Come on, let’s go!”</p><p>And you both run. You get in Shadow’s car and you take the wheel wordlessly while he texts Laura goodbye.</p>
