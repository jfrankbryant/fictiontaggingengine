      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>After Luther dies at the hands of The Commission, God offers him a second chance. And another. And another.</p><p>Over and over again. </p><p>-</p><p>A rewrite of my fic “i keep seeing you (again and again)” because although I thoroughly enjoyed it, the plot was all over the place. </p><p>Purely self indulgent, not beta-read.</p></blockquote>

      <p align="center"> </p><p>It’s funny that this happened to him.</p><p>Him, of all people.</p><p>Luther would understand if it was Allison. She’d regret her actions for so long. It was torture to be away from her daughter. From the light of her life.</p><p>He’d understand if it was Five.</p><p>Five was not the kind of person to regret his actions. But Luther knew, from that rare grimace over the topic, or when he’d blink away a little too recklessly. Luther knew it was a sore subject for him — and Luther didn’t think Five would mind if he could go over once again. </p><p>Luther would even understand if it was Klaus. His brother, however messed he may be, was a good person. The person with the best intentions, one could say.</p><p>Luther just didn’t know why it was him.</p><p> </p><p>”It has to be you.” She says, finally turning to him.</p><p>Luther steps back, startled. God is much younger than he thought. Not a single ageline ran across her youthful face, and the scene the two of them walked along was reminiscent of a lighthearted painting. The ones mom would watch over for hours.</p><p>She continues, treading down the black and white path with her equally as monotone bike in arm. </p><p>Luther bites his lip, breathing heavily. He can hear his heart pounding. It’s too silent in here.</p><p>”You’ve got to tell me why!” Luther says, eyebrows sinking lower. “You’ve atleast got to tell me why.” </p><p>She turns to face him again. Her neutral face doesn’t give much away, but she parts her mouth, and Luther almost feels his hopes rise — “No.” She drops, pressing a single finger to his forehead.</p><p>He can feel too much happen at once — first he’s falling, tripping and tipping over at each sway of gravity, then he can’t breath. He swims in the empty nothing on reflex, coughing and trying to get any single breath he can, before theres a flash of light.</p><p>Luther thinks he’s dead. Convinced himself he’s dead. </p><p>But Luther’s empty wishes are left unanswered, when the world comes back to him, and his body resumes control under himself. </p><p>There’s whispering, hushes, and a clatter on the left. </p><p>“Luther, dear, can you hear me?” </p><p>Luther feels his insides drop. It’s that voice. The voice he didn’t think he’d hear again. He was never that fond of the voice, the stray shock he’d get ever now and then from pressing a hand against her synthetic skin. The voice that was the sole narrator of his youth. </p><p>He mutters the only thing he can. The only thing appropriate for the situation at hand.</p><p>“Fuck.” </p>
