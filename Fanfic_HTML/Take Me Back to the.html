    <div class="userstuff">
      <p><em>Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry</em><br/>
<em>You don't know how lovely you are...</em><br/>
<br/>
The cuts on Brad's face were healing, the numerous bruises slightly faded, when Patrick arrived at his locker to find his once-boyfriend standing there.<br/>
<br/>
'I'm surprised you're going to taunt me without backup this time,' Patrick told him with an attempt at indifference. 'Please move aside?'<br/>
<br/>
Brad seemed about to speak, but unable to find words.<br/>
<br/>
<em>...I had to find you</em><br/>
<em>Tell you I need you</em><br/>
<em>Tell you I set you apart...</em><br/>
<br/>
Brad took a breath, then sighed nervously, and didn't move. 'Not taunting,' he mumbled eventually.<br/>
<br/>
Patrick smiled weakly. 'Oh, good. In that case, you're not here for anything, so I'd thank you to move. There are things I'd rather be doing.'<br/>
<br/>
'I need to talk to you,' Brad burst out. 'Please, Patrick.'<br/>
<br/>
<em>...Tell me your secrets</em><br/>
<em>And ask me your questions</em><br/>
<em>Oh, let's go back to the start...</em><br/>
<br/>
'I'm not interested in your shit,' Patrick's voice was almost as certain-sounding as he wanted it to be.<br/>
<br/>
<em>...Running in circles</em><br/>
<em>Coming up tails</em><br/>
<em>Heads on a science apart...</em><br/>
<br/>
Brad faltered. 'It's not going to be- listen, OK? God, I didn't want to do this in public... I'm sorry. And I really mean it. I was disrespectful to you; that was wrong, and I'm not asking you to, because I'll never expect you'll want to, but I wish we could give it another try.' His eyes roamed over Patrick's face until Patrick looked back. Brad dropped his gaze.<br/>
<br/>
<em>...Nobody said it was easy</em><br/>
<em>It's such a shame for us to part</em><br/>
<em>Nobody said it was easy</em><br/>
<em>No one ever said it would be this hard</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>Oh, take me back to the start...</em><br/>
<br/>
A small crowd had gathered over the course of Brad's speech. Patrick noticed them staring.<br/>
<br/>
'Wanna go somewhere else?' he murmured, quietly enough that only the apologetic figure before him could hear. Brad nodded gratefully, and Patrick led him to an out-of-the-way dead-end hallway.<br/>
<br/>
'Now tell me what you need someone to hear,' Patrick requested soberly but gently.<br/>
<br/>
<em>...I was just guessing</em><br/>
<em>At numbers and figures</em><br/>
<em>Pulling the puzzles apart...</em><br/>
<br/>
'That day... you know the one, the cafeteria one... I didn't know how to feel... I didn't want anyone to know... My father said some stuff... more, after you'd gone. Not just the 'unnatural' stuff, the 'how are you going to succeed in anything' stuff. He went, he went really quiet. Started saying how disappointed and ashamed he was.'<br/>
<br/>
<em>...Questions of science</em><br/>
<em>Science and progress</em><br/>
<em>Do not speak as loud as my heart...</em><br/>
<br/>
Brad swallowed. 'Anyway, I know he's the shittiest- you know what I mean... but I didn't want to be a disappointment, so I thought... but it didn't work. I still hated it when they hit you. But I didn't do anything about it. I still didn't want to be a disappointment. And I kind of wanted to keep my friends as well.<br/>
<br/>
But they...' he sighed. 'You like (sorry, liked) me as whoever I, kind of, am, you know (this is such cliched crap), like, by myself. As myself. If they knew... they'd treat me like I treated you... They're not... I like you better.'<br/>
<br/>
<em>...Tell me you love me</em><br/>
<em>Come back and haunt me</em><br/>
<em>Oh, and I rush to the start...</em><br/>
<br/>
Patrick bit his lip. 'You'll be in big trouble with your father if he finds out you spoke to me like that.' Brad nodded. 'I need a chance to think, Brad. Can you give me that? Like, a day? I'm angry, a bit angry, with you, but I don't want to get you in trouble. And I think I'd like to... I just need time to think, OK?' Brad nodded again.<br/>
<br/>
<em>...Running in circles</em><br/>
<em>Chasing our tails</em><br/>
<em>Coming back as we are...</em><br/>
<br/>
'I, er, we should probably get on,' said Patrick. 'I'll talk to you, OK?' He touched Brad's hand briefly and smiled a quick smile and started away.<br/>
<br/>
<em>...Nobody said it was easy</em><br/>
<em>Oh, it's such a shame for us to part</em><br/>
<em>Nobody said it was easy</em><br/>
<em>No one ever said it would be so hard...</em><br/>
<br/>
Patrick turned back. 'Brad? I hope I didn't hurt you too much, when I,' he laughed guiltily, 'punched you.'<br/>
<br/>
Brad smiled. 'It's fine.'</p><p>
