  <p>For Liesel Meminger, the early stages of 1949 could be easily summed up like this:</p><p>She became twenty years of age. Her smile was no longer starving, and it was no longer a rarity. She had finally moved to Sydney, Australia. And the man with swampy eyes and feathers of hair was on her bed. Again.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <b>* * *  Q&amp;A * * *</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>How did Max</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>Vandenburg end up</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>In Liesel Meminger’s bed?</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>He fell. However this time, </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>the Jewish Fistfighter</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>was not sick.</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>There were no varying opinions on how Max Vandenburg ended up laying breathless on Liesel’s bed. The Book Thief, the Word Shaker, the little <em> Saumensch </em> herself pushed him there. Giggling. Liesel Meminger had the audacity to giggle as she pushed Max Vandenburg onto her piles of books and blankets that made her bed. But those blankets. They felt like clouds underneath his rough fingertips. Liesel’s blankets smelled of her. It reminded Max that he was alive. And that he was with Liesel, the girl who had once reminded him of how the sun felt on his skin, and what the air was like to breathe. Only Liesel wasn’t a girl anymore. And Max didn’t have to hide anymore.</p><p align="left">

  <b>* * *  A NOTE FROM YOUR NARRATOR  * * *</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>In all actuality, Liesel’s</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>blankets would also become</b>
</p><p align="center"><b>Max’s blankets. </b> <b> <em>Their</em> </b> <b> blankets.</b></p><p align="center">
  <b> They just didn’t know it yet. </b>
</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>“Liesel,” Max said as she flopped next to him, German blonde hair falling in a halo around her shoulders, the taste of words and ink and hope on her lips.</p><p>“Max,” Liesel said. And her voice. Her voice was such a healing sound. The words that streamed out of her mouth like the sun helped to mend his wounds. Hands, fire, gas, whips, and basements had broken him. But dear God, Liesel and her snowmen and her smiles and her warmth and her books and her words and her voice had stitched him back together. She was alive. And he was alive. And he had her. And she had him. And together, they healed.  </p><p>“Read to me,” Max whispered, his swampy eyes looking into her chocolate ones.</p><p>And so she did. Liesel reached under him and pulled out one of her thousands of books. <em> The Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales. </em></p><p>“Chapter One: The Golden Bird.” Liesel was such a smooth reader now, the words flowing out of her mouth as if she was born with a book clutched in her hands. “A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone…”</p><p align="left">

  <b>* * * SOME THOUGHTS * * *</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>OF MAX VANDENBURG</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>Our favorite Jewish Fistfighter </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>knew, by this point in his</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>life, that he was in love with</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> the Book Thief. He just didn’t</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> know that she was in love </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>with him too.</b>
</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>When Liesel was done the first chapter, she drank in the sight of Max. His arms were toned, his push-ups and sit-ups were giving him some muscle. His hair, still feathery, was speckled with hints of gray. His eyes, a swamp living in both of them, were closed. A thin smile graced his lips as Liesel’s silence continued on.</p><p>“Liesel, I can feel you staring at me,” Max said, opening his eyes and looking at her.</p><p>“Oh,” Liesel said. She could feel her cheeks heating up. A light rosy pink dusted her face.</p><p><em> “Ja </em> - yes.” Max swallowed hard at the sight of her blush. Then he quickly said, “Liesel, one day I’m going to take you apple picking.”</p><p>Liesel, words suddenly failing her, continued to read, a small smile gracing her lips at Max’s words. The two of them, friends who were awkwardly in love with each other, read until they fell asleep on Liesel’s blankets, which were made out of a hopeful future.</p><p>For Liesel, the warmth of Max, and the knowledge that his feathery hair and swampy eyes and 5 o’clock shadow were right next to her, breathing and alive, was enough to keep her nightmares - at least the bad ones - at bay.</p><p>However, not even Max Vandenburg could get Liesel’s brother or the boy who was destined to have lemon hair forever, out of her dreams.</p><p>Liesel, though the main reason of Max’s survival, could not, despite her German blonde hair and chocolate eyes and full smile, keep his nightmares away. Every night, the visions of leaving his family, of piles of dead Jews, of pillars of smoke, of soul-crushing hunger, of leaving Liesel and the street named after heaven, of walking and crying and Liesel calling out for him and him kissing her palms, danced across his mind.</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>* * *  A LATE NIGHT CONVERSATION  * * *</b>
</p><p align="center"><b> <em>Liesel:</em> </b> <b> “Tell me. What did you see this time?”</b></p><p align="center"><b> <em>Max:</em> </b> <b> “You, Liesel. I saw you.”</b></p><p align="center"><b> <em>Liesel:</em> </b> <b> “Me?” </b></p><p align="center">
  <b>She was shocked, still not fully realizing that </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>she also haunted the man she loved so much.</b>
</p><p align="center"><b> <em>Max:</em> </b> <b> “You, when I kissed your palms, during the march.</b></p><p align="center">
  <b>When you got kicked and manhandled and whipped. When</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>I was so helpless I couldn’t even protect you.”  </b>
</p><p align="center"><b> <em>Liesel:</em> </b> <b> “Max, you’ve always protected me.” A pause.</b></p><p align="center">
  <b>“I’m sorry.” </b>
</p><p align="center"><b> <em>Max:</em> </b> <b> “You saved me. It is I who should be apologizing to you.”</b></p><p align="center"><b> <em>Liesel:</em> </b> <b> “Never feel the need to apologize to me for saving you.</b></p><p align="center">
  <b> I would do it again, if I had to.”</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>Max Vandenburg really wanted to kiss Liesel Meminger, </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>but he didn’t. He allowed her read to him until they</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>both fell back asleep, a tangle of limbs. </b>
</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>When Liesel Meminger woke up the next morning, there was a painting on her bedroom wall, and an empty spot where Max Vandenburg should have been. He was cooking breakfast for them, and Liesel could smell it. But that act of kindness was not what made Liesel Meminger’s heart throb.</p><p>The painting, which displayed a young, blonde German woman, and a slightly older, feathery-haired Jewish man holding hands as they tightrope walked towards a huge, heavenly, pink rose that radiated like the sun. The image made flowers bloom in Liesel’s chest even though no art critic would think that it was any semblance of good. But to Liesel, Max’s painting was too beautiful to look directly at, yet she couldn’t peel her eyes away from it.</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>Humans are so emotional, so self destructive.</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>* * *  SOME THOUGHTS * * *</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>OF LIESEL MEMINGER </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>She wanted to scream:</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>Look at this painting! </em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>This beautiful, wonderful, painting!</em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>My boy, my beautiful boy,</em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>He paints the flowers and</em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>the entire universe for me.</em> </b>
</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>That morning, Liesel Meminger and Max Vandenburg shared their first kiss. And what a wonderful kiss it was. And to think it was all because of a painting. A painting that a sleep deprived Jew created when the words that had so craftily healed him disappeared into the void of sleep.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <b>* * *  A NOTE ABOUT  * * *</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>THEIR GERMAN AND JEWISH KISS  </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>It was comprised of three main things:</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> <b>1. The taste of books and words and ink</b> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>2. Flowers blooming in the wake of destruction</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>3. The roughness of Max’s lips</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>“You are a wonder, Liesel,” Max whispered as they pulled away. And Liesel smiled. Oh, how she smiled. It nearly blinded Max. That’s how bright she smiled.</p><p>“One could say the same thing about you, Max.” Now, it was Max’s face that turned a light shade of rosy pink. Liesel giggled at his blush. Giggled for God’s sake. It was Max’s turn for a heart throb. When Liesel kissed him again, he laughed. The same laugh of absolute joy and hope and wonder that he let out when she had walked down the steps of the Hubermann home with a snowman in her arms. It was the sound of a miracle.</p><p>“Liesel, I love you.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Liesel,” Max said, “I was being serious.”</p><p>“Don’t pout, you <em> Dummkopf </em>- idiot,” Liesel whispered, her voice now earnest as well “I love you more than words can express.”</p><p>Max grinned, “That’s a lot of love.”</p><p>“You’re beautiful,” Liesel said simply, “of course I love you that much.”</p><p>Max’s heart skipped a beat at what Liesel had told him. He was so in love with her. He knew, from the depths of his soul, that Liesel Meminger would never leave him.</p><p align="left">

  <b> </b>
</p><p>For Liesel Meminger, the early stages of 1950 could be easily summed up like this:</p><p>She was now twenty-one years of age. Her first book, dedicated to the boy with lemon hair - his name was still too painful to write - was published, and the love of her life, a man with feathers of hair and swampy eyes, finally moved into her apartment.</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>* * *  A NOTE FROM YOUR NARRATOR  * * *</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>Upon Max’s arrival to Liesel’s </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>small apartment, her blankets became their</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>blankets. Max and Liesel shared a life, and it was</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>only a matter of time before they shared</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>blankets made of clouds. </b>
</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>The world that Liesel and Max shared together was filled of books and pens and ink and nightmares and healing and warmth. Liesel’s voice was still the most comforting thing in Max’s life. And to Liesel, Max was everything that a home should be. And more.</p><p>It was April when Max finally took Liesel apple picking, like he had promised to do the previous year. Her cheeks were rosy from the crispness of the day, her German blonde hair was slowly falling out of the bun that sat atop of her head.</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m picking apples,” Liesel hummed into the orange air. “It’s the first time I’ve done this legally.”  </p><p>Max chuckled. “Liesel, do I even want to know what that means?”</p><p>“Rudy,” Liesel said quietly, her voice trailing off as Max stiffened, his face softened as he looked at her. She cleared her throat and continued, “We were so hungry during the summers. We stole apples from farmers.”</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>And thus, the tradition of apple picking during the month of April was born.</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>It was April of 1950, and Liesel Meminger could finally speak about her past. It was April of 1950, and Max Vandenburg wished he could speak about his.</p><p align="left">

</p><p align="center">
  <b>Max Vandenburg would never be </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>able to talk about</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>death camps and fires and ashes and</b>
</p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center">
  <b>would write about them instead.</b>
</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>It was late April of 1950, when Max and Liesel talked about the men that plagued their dreams. The Word Shaker was not the only person that Max Vandenburg had shared his heart with, and the Jewish Fistfighter was not the only boy that Liesel Meminger had loved.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p>It was April of 1950 and while Max Vandenburg could not speak about his past, he could finally come to terms with the love he had for a man, a Nazi, a savior, a friend: Walter Kugler</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>Max Vandenburg wrote down his most important memories in notebooks. Words spilled out of him until no more could be clumsily poured onto paper.</p><p align="left">

</p><p>Max Vandenburg was sprawled out on the bed he shared with Liesel Meminger. His fingertips were stained with ink, his eyes were huge and swampy, and his feathers of hair were more than just sprinkled with gray. Liesel was laying with her head on his chest, her German blonde hair making Max’s shirt glow. The blankets under them were beautiful and soft. Like clouds. It was late. The outside sky was black. Blacker than the ink and words that created our Book Thief.  </p><p>“Max,” Liesel whispered.</p><p><em> “Ja </em> - yes, Liesel?”</p><p>“I’m afraid.”</p><p>“Of what, Liesel?”</p><p>“Of sleeping, Max.”</p><p>Max Vandenburg sat up in their bed. Liesel sat up next to him. He held her cold fingers with his inky ones. He kissed her German fingertips, and murmured words of love.</p><p>“I’m going to read to you, Liesel,” Max said quietly, his voice soft. “And if you fall asleep, I will shake you until you wake up.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Liesel said softly. And Max kissed her. Their kiss tasted like wishes finally coming true.</p><p>“Liesel, do not thank me for this,” Max said, his voice kind. “I want to help you, like how you help me.”</p><p>“Max,” Liesel said, her fingers tracing through his feathers of hair. His name on her lips was like a prayer.</p><p>“Liesel,” Max said. They smiled at each other. Awkward smiles full of love and hope.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

His voice washed over Liesel, bathed her in comfort.</p><p>“Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Grethel.

Her second book, dedicated to her brother, was published. And the man with swampy eyes and feathers of hair was sitting on their bed. Not an uncommon occurrence.</p><p>“Liesel.”</p><p>“Max.”</p><p>“Show me that I’m going to make it.” His voice was hoarse. He looked so broken. <em> “Please.” </em></p><p>Liesel said nothing, just cupped his face in her hands. Rubbed her thumb over his bearded jawline. Kissed him hard. Their kiss wasn’t beautiful. It wasn’t wonderful. It tasted of desperation and survivor’s guilt.</p><p align="left">

  <span>At the bookstore, two other women Liesel’s age, Ann Campbell and Elizabeth Taylor, worked. They gossiped about the latest neighborhood scandals, whispered in hushed tones about things Liesel could never quite catch, and complained about their jobs. Liesel listened to them, interacted with them, but never added anything to their conversations.</span>

</p><p>On this day, a Thursday, Liesel was reading a play behind the counter when the bell that signaled the opening of the front door rang. Stooped under the doorway was the Jewish Fistfighter with feathers of hair and swampy eyes. In his hands was a brown paper bag.</p><p>“Max,” Liesel said, smiling. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“It was my lunch break at work,” Max replied softly, making his way to the counter that Liesel stood behind, “and you forgot your lunch at home. I figured we could share mine.”</p><p>“You’re sweet, Max.”</p><p>His eyes looked down at the book she was reading. “Lady Windermere’s Fan”<em> . </em> Oscar Wilde.</p><p>“Is it any good?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t know,” Liesel said, chocolate eyes boring into Max’s swampy ones. “I’ve only just started it.” Max grinned at her. She got a coworker to take her counter place. Their lunch break was a beautiful one.</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>When Liesel got back to work after lunch, Max opened the door for her and then kissed her cheek before leaving, and Ann and Elizabeth questioned her.</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>“Who is he?” Elizabeth asked. </p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>“Why haven’t you told us about him? He’s seducing you, isn’t he?” Ann said. She paused before saying, "Is he always that cute?”</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>“His name is Max,” Liesel said quietly as she returned to her play. “And he’s the man I’m going to marry.”</p><p align="left">

</p><p align="center">
  <b>Liesel was correct in her statement. </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>Max Vandenburg was indeed the man she was going to marry.</b>
</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>In April of 1951, Max Vandenburg took Liesel Meminger apple picking for the second time. It was autumn, the leaves crunched beneath their feet, and the sky was different hues of oranges, yellows, pinks, and reds. Liesel looked so beautiful with her hair blowing in the wind, her face rosy from the cold, her lips oddly chapped. Max smiled at her as he tossed her an apple. She laughed, and put it in their basket.</p><p>“How has work been?” Max asked, almost sheepishly.</p><p>“They talk about you,” Liesel said, smiling one of her secret smiles.</p><p>“About me?” Max asked and threw her another apple.</p><p>“Yes,” Liesel said. Then she added, rather timidly, “They think you’re seducing me.” Max appeared to choke on the air around him. He could feel his face heating up.</p><p>“Liesel,” Max said, looking at the ink on his fingertips, “we’re together. I can’t possibly be seducing you.”</p><p>“If you’re not seducing me, Max,” Liesel said, a wicked smirk dancing on her lips, “then what would you call what happened last night?”</p><p>Max let loose a strangled laugh, “Liesel Meminger.”</p><p>“Max Vandenburg.”</p><p>“Sometimes I cannot believe you say the things that come out of your mouth.”</p><p>“Dance with me,” Liesel said.</p><p>Max looked at her as if she hung the sun in the sky, “Liesel, we’re in the middle of an orchard, you’re holding a basket of apples, and there’s no music.”</p><p>“Max,” Liesel said, “that sounds like a lot of excuses to not dance with the little minx you’re currently seducing.”</p><p>Max laughed. "If anything, Liesel," he said, "you're seducing me."  </p><p align="left">Liesel put down her basket of apples. And they danced through the crisp autumn air, the colors of the sky mixing with their happiness.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center">
  <b>Secretly, Max Vandenburg liked the idea of seducing Liesel Meminger. </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>Perhaps he liked the truth of the idea.</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>Or</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>Perhaps he liked the flirtatiousness of it. </b>
</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>In May of 1951, Max Vandenburg was dressed in his best suit, and Liesel Meminger wore a deep red dress. It pinched her waist and flared out at the knees. Her hair was done up in a bunch of twists and knots that made her blonde German hair look like the tightrope Max had painted in their bedroom. Max adored her hair. To be frank, Max simply adored Liesel.</p><p align="left">
  <b> </b>
</p><p>The German and the Jew were going on a date.</p><p align="left">

</p><p> </p><p>Yes, Max Vandenburg, once a piece of Jewish scum, now a Jewish survivor, proposed to the pretty German woman by the name of Liesel Meminger in May of 1951. They were sitting on a park bench in town. The sky’s colors were mixing and melting together like a child’s drawing. The Jewish Fistfighter handed the Word Shaker a book wrapped in the most delicate of paper.</p><p>“Max?” Liesel asked, looking at the man sitting next to her.</p><p>“Please, just open it,” Max said, voice soft and swampy eyes huge.</p><p>So she did. In her hands was an old copy of <em> The Dream Carrier </em>, the book that Liesel had read to Max, so many years ago, when he was cold and melting in her bed all at the same time. On the cover, tied to the book in thin pink rope was a small, diamond ring. Nothing fancy, nothing special. But to Liesel Meminger, the ring was the third most beautiful thing she had ever seen, and she could feel her heart bursting.</p><p align="left">

  <p>For Liesel Meminger, the early stages of 1952 could be easily summed up like this:</p><p>She became twenty-three years of age. Her third book, one meant for children, dedicated to Hans and Rosa Hubermann, was published. Her fiancée, our Jewish Fistfighter with feathers of hair and swampy eyes, resumed his childhood tendencies of brawling with those who angered him. </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"><b></b> <b>They reminded him </b></p><p align="center"><b>that he was alive</b> <b></b></p><p align="center"> </p><p>One night, Max came home with a split lip and a bruised face. His swampy right eye was swollen shut and painted with hues of blues and blacks and purples. Undertones of green and yellow. Liesel nearly screamed at the sight of him.</p><p>“Max?” Her voice made him shudder. He wished he could sink into her voice, wrap himself within it, and never leave. </p><p>“Liesel.” </p><p>“What happened,<em> saukerl?” </em> Her words were harsh. Her voice was not.</p><p>“Someone was talking about,” Max said, breathing heavily, “the führer.” </p><p>“Max.” </p><p>“Liesel.”</p><p>She took his hand in hers, led him to the bathroom, and sat him on the edge of the tub. His swampy left eye looked up at her. The other one was looking like a piece of modern art. Max looked like a shell of a man; he appeared so small and hurt as he looked up at Liesel. She ran her fingers through his feathers of hair, kissed his forehead, and treated his lip with rubbing alcohol and his eye with ice. She was so gentle with him. Her fingertips made out of love. </p><p>“I’m sorry, Liesel,” Max said once Liesel sat down next to him on the edge of their tub.</p><p>“Why?” Liesel asked. </p><p>“I don’t mean to worry you.”</p><p>“Max,” Liesel whispered, “I always worry about you.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because you’re beautiful,” Liesel said. “And the world isn’t kind to beautiful people.”  </p><p>“Liesel,” Max said. His swampy eye was giving her a look. “I love you.” </p><p>Liesel snorted, “I know you do.” Her voice softened: “It’s nice to hear your voice.”</p><p>Max tilted his chin up at her, “I prefer your voice to mine, Liesel.” There was a pause before Max asked, his voice barely more than a whisper, “will you read to me tonight?”</p><p>Liesel kissed Max’s hair before murmuring, “Of course, Max.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <b>For Max Vandenburg and Liesel Meminger,</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>the year started out rough, </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>but it was only going to get worse.</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>It was the first Friday in February of 1952 when Alex Steiner’s soul drifted into my arms. It was heavy, burdened with the loss of his family and the emptiness he felt after Liesel left Munich for Australia. Ilsa Hermann prepared his funeral. Only three people came.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

  <b>Ilsa Hermann herself. </b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>When the service was done, Liesel was given two gifts from Frau Hermann.</p><p>“He left these for you,” Ilsa said. Her voice was soft and broken. Liesel could taste Ilsa’s grief. It lingered in the air. She handed Liesel two parcels, each wrapped in newspaper.</p><p>“What are they?” Liesel asked as she took them from Ilsa’s hands. Their fingertips brushed. </p><p>“Pictures,” Ilsa said. “They are framed. One kept him alive during the war, and the other is a wedding gift for you and Herr Vandenburg.”</p><p>Liesel and Max exchanged looks. A flicker of confusion flashed through Liesel’s chocolate eyes, and questions danced in Max’s swampy ones. </p><p>“A wedding gift?” Max asked, looking at the ring on Liesel’s finger.</p><p>Ilsa glanced at Max passingly before simply saying, “Herr Steiner knew you two would get married.”</p><p>“Oh.” </p><p>“ <em> Ja </em> - yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Liesel and Max left the next day. They did not say goodbye to Ilsa Hermann.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

  <b>They tasted like healing.</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>It was April. The Jewish Fistfighter took the Book Thief’s hand in his, and led her throughout an apple orchard. In his other hand was a brown basket. It was filled with red apples. The sky was orange and swirled into pink. The air was cold against their faces. </p><p>“Liesel?” </p><p>“Max?”</p><p>“Have an apple,” Max said softly. </p><p>Liesel looked at Max, her chocolate eyes big. Vulnerable. </p><p>“Please, Liesel,” Max whispered. </p><p>They stopped walking near a tree. Max placed the basket of apples on the ground. He sat down next to it. Pulled Liesel into his lap. </p><p>“Max, what are you doing?” Liesel asked, smiling slightly. </p><p>“That,” Max said, nudging the curve of Liesel’s smile with his cold nose.</p><p>He handed Liesel an apple. It was round and red. His inky fingertips brushed her cold ones. She took a bite. She swallowed, and he kissed her. The taste of apples and words were on her lips. He shuddered. She brushed his stubble with her thumb. </p><p>“Thank you, Max,” Liesel said. </p><p>“For what?” Max asked. His eyebrows were knitted together. </p><p>“For bringing me here today.”</p><p>She smiled at him. She took another bite of apple. He kissed her again. </p><p align="left">

Max kept looking at Liesel with wonder. </p><p>“Liesel Meminger,” Max said after Liesel giggled for the millionth time. </p><p>“Max Vandenburg,” Liesel said. </p><p>Her chocolate eyes bore into his swampy ones.</p><p>“You truly are a gift to this universe.”</p><p>Ann’s eyebrows raised. “Liesel,” she said, “you never told us that he was a smooth talker!”</p><p>Liesel buried her head in her hands, her German blonde hair flying everywhere. Max looked over at Liesel softly, fond amusement written all over his face. </p><p>“Ann,” she laughed, “stop it!”</p><p>“Yeah, Ann,” Elizabeth said, “I agree with Liesel for once.”</p><p>“Oh, you’re just jealous, Eliza,” Ann said.</p><p>Elizabeth looked at Ann with wide eyes. Ann turned bright red as she turned toward Max.</p><p>“You can’t help who you fall in love with,” Max said earnestly, recalling something Liesel had told him years ago. His thoughts filled with Walter Kugler and the taste of blood that filled their kisses. Ann and Elizabeth grinned at him, and Liesel smiled her secret smile at Max. </p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <b>Max’s feathers of hair.</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Later, Max and Liesel curled in their blankets of clouds. Max was reading aloud from a book of fairy tales:</p><p>“Death’s Messengers,” Max said, his voice low and rough and full of comfort. “In ancient times a giant was once traveling on a great highway, when suddenly an unknown man sprang up before him, and said, halt, not one step further. ‘What,’ cried the giant, ‘a creature whom I can crush between my fingers, wants to block my way.  Who are you that you dare to speak so boldly?’ ‘I am death,’ answered the other. ‘No one resists me, and you also must obey my commands.’ But the giant refused, and began to struggle with death….” </p><p>When the story ended, Liesel buried her head under the crook of Max’s arm. </p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>For Liesel Meminger, the early stages of 1954 could be easily summed up like this:</p><p>She became twenty-five years of age. She now worked full-time at the bookstore. She was writing a draft for the final novel she would publish. And she was currently shopping for wedding dresses with Ann and Elizabeth.</p><p>The dress was laced with flowers and clinched her waist, then flowed like a waterfall down to the floor. Her German blonde hair was braided and knotted on the top of her head, the wedding veil falling only slightly past her shoulders. She walked out of the fitting room, Ann and Elizabeth staring at her as she walked toward them.</p><p>“This is the one!” Ann breathed out, her voice excited.</p><p>“You think?” Liesel asked, and her voice would have been the death of Max Vandenburg if he had been there. It was filled with excitement and threaded with ink and hope. </p><p>“I think so,” Ann said. </p><p>Liesel turned to Elizabeth. “What do you think?”</p><p>Elizabeth smirked, “You look like a damsel in distress.”</p><p>“Is that a good thing?” Liesel asked, quirking an eyebrow.</p><p>“Yes,” Elizabeth said, “You look like you’ve walked right out of a fairytale.”</p><p>Liesel’s chocolate eyes widened and she smiled that full smile of hers. </p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Max Vandenburg’s swampy eyes were watering when Liesel Meminger walked into their home. He was sitting on their couch, reading a letter.</p><p>“Max!” Liesel said excitedly, “I got the dress. It just needs to be hemmed -” she turned the corner and her voice stopped in her throat. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Walter Kugler,” Max whispered. “He’s alive.”</p><p>“Why is that a problem?” Liesel whispered, laying her dress on the back of their chair, and wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>“He didn’t look for me, Liesel,” Max mumbled into her stomach. “After the war, he didn’t look for me. He just started looking for me now.”</p><p>“Did you look for him?” Liesel asked, combing her fingers through Max’s feathers of hair. She felt his body trembling beneath her.</p><p>“I did, Liesel,” Max sobbed. “You’ve got to believe me. I looked for him.” </p><p>“I believe you,” Liesel said and Max shuddered, leaning into her warmth. </p><p>“Liesel, I’m so sorry,” Max hiccuped. </p><p>Liesel looked at Max as if he hung the moon and the stars in the sky and kissed his hairline. “Max Vandenburg, you’ve got nothing to be sorry for.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t be crying about Walter,” Max mumbled. </p><p>“Of course you should,” Liesel whispered back, “he was your first love.”</p><p>Max burst into a fresh round of tears and hugged Liesel closer to him.</p><p>“Hey,” Liesel whispered, “I’m right here. I’m always going to be right here, Max.” </p><p>“I love you, Liesel,” Max said. His voice was raw and emotional and beautiful.</p><p>“I love you,” Liesel said, the taste of words and ink and hope on her lips.</p><p>“Kiss me,” Max said, his swampy eyes boring into her chocolate ones. “Show me that I’m going to be okay, Liesel.”</p><p>Liesel looked at him softly, rubbed his bearded jawline with her thumb, and kissed Max hard on the mouth. </p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <b>It was not beautiful. </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>It tasted of guilt and hurt and desperation.</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>A few days later, Liesel tentatively broached the subject of Walter Kugler. Max was on their couch, wrapped in their blankets. Not an unusual occurrence. Liesel sat down next to him and put her feet in his lap.</p><p>“Max.”</p><p>“Liesel.” </p><p>“We can invite Walter to dinner, if you’d like.”</p><p>“I’m not sure if he’s still in Australia, Liesel.”</p><p>“It wouldn’t hurt to ask.”</p><p>“Liesel,” Max said, “I don’t know. Wouldn’t it be uncomfortable for you?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t be uncomfortable with him coming over.”</p><p>Max took Liesel’s cold fingertips into his ink-stained ones. </p><p>“I’ve missed him, Liesel,” Max whispered, his voice hoarse. “I don’t love him, but I miss him, I really do.”</p><p>“It’s okay if you still love him, Max,” Liesel said quietly. “There is room in your heart to love more than one person.”</p><p>“Do you still love Rudy?” Max asked, looking at Liesel with swampy eyes.</p><p>“Not really,” Liesel said, her chocolate eyes looking at where her feet laid on Max’s lap.</p><p>“Not really?” Max asked.</p><p>“There will always be a small piece of my heart that belongs to Rudy Steiner,” Liesel said simply. She looked at Max, her German blonde hair framing her face beautifully as it fell out of her bun. “But the rest of my heart belongs to you, Max Vandenburg. You and your paintings and your feathers of hair and your ink-stained fingertips and your warmth. You’re the love of my life, Max,” Liesel whispered, “my home.”</p><p>“Liesel,” Max said, his voice breaking.  “I don’t want to hurt you.”</p><p>“You won’t.” </p><p>There was a beat of silence before Max asked shyly, “Can we have Walter over for dinner?”</p><p>Liesel smirked, “Do you promise not to seduce him?”</p><p>Max’s face flushed. “I - I - I,” he stuttered. “Liesel, <em> he </em> kissed <em> me </em>first. I’ve never seduced anyone.”</p><p>Liesel snorted. “Sure, Max.”</p><p>Max’s face was still flushed when he said, “It’s just my natural charm, then.”</p><p>Liesel tilted her head back, laughing. </p><p>“What?” Max asked. “I’m very charming.”</p><p>“I know, dear,” Liesel said, patting Max’s leg. She got up from the couch. “I’m going to make supper now.”</p><p>Max unwrapped his blankets, “I’ll join you.”</p><p>Liesel rolled her eyes. </p><p>“You love me and you know it, <em> saumensch </em>.”</p><p>“Sadly, I do, <em>saukerl</em>.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">Liesel was sitting on the couch next to Max, and Walter sat on the chair opposite them. The dinner the three of them shared had been filled with lapses of long, excruciating silence, and uncomfortable conversation.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">

He took a deep breath: “She’s the adopted daughter of Hans and Rosa Hubermann.”</p><p>Walter’s ocean eyes looked into Liesel’s chocolate ones. Liesel couldn’t read his face. </p><p>“I didn’t realize you were that much younger than him,” Walter said. </p><p>Liesel shrugged, “He didn’t truly seduce me until I was twenty.”</p><p>“Liesel!” Max said, face flushing. He buried his head into Liesel’s shoulder and Walter burst out laughing. </p><p>“Max couldn’t seduce anyone if he tried,” Walter smirked.</p><p>Max mumbled into Liesel’s shoulder, “I told you so.”</p><p>Walter said, lips curling into a smile, “It must be his natural charm, then.”</p><p>“Oh, he’s very charming,” Liesel giggled. </p><p>“Shut up, Liesel,” Max groaned. “Must you always embarrass me, <em> saumensch </em>?” </p><p>“Yes, <em> saukerl </em>,” Liesel said. </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <b>*****</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Max Vandenburg and Walter Kugler were saying goodbye. They stood near the doorway to Max and Liesel’s home. </p><p>“I’ve missed you,” Max said, swampy eyes looking at his feet.</p><p>Walter took Max’s chin in his hand and lifted his face so that their eyes met. </p><p>“I’ve missed you more,” Walter said, letting go of Max’s face. Ocean eyes drifted over to where Liesel was reading on the couch. “No doubt about that.”</p><p>Max hummed, a pink color dusting his cheeks. “We’ve only got three people going to our wedding. I wouldn’t mind it if you and your… <em> American </em> boy made the guest list five.”</p><p>Walter smiled, “Give me a time and place, and I’ll make sure to be there.”</p><p>“Can I ask you something?” Max asked.</p><p>“Anything.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you look for me?”</p><p>“I care about you, Max.”</p><p>“That wasn’t my question.”</p><p>“Max,” Walter said, suddenly feeling quite shy, “I don’t think that I could have handled searching for you, just to find out that you were already dead. I didn’t look for you because I would rather you be alive in my brain, than knowing the truth.”</p><p>“Oh,” Max said. “Well, I’m alive.”</p><p>“And in love.” </p><p>“You’ve moved on, too.”</p><p>“He’s not you, Max,” Walter said. </p><p>Max’s face flushed again, “You were my first love.”</p><p>“I know,” Walter said, smirking. “But I’m not your last love, and you’re not my last love either.”</p><p>Max nodded. “Do you love your American boy?”</p><p>“His name is James,” Walter said, “and I’m afraid so.”</p><p>Max grinned, “Good for you, Walter.”</p><p>“Good for me?” Walter asked, laughing. “Liesel is like nothing else I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Max looked over at her, “She is a wonder.”</p><p>Walter said, “I’m glad that you’re alive.”</p><p>“I’m glad you’re alive, too,” Max said.</p><p>Walter looked at the watch on his wrist, “I’m sorry, but I do have to go. I told James that I would be at the hotel by midnight.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Max said. “Will you write me?”</p><p>“Of course,” Walter said. “Don’t forget my wedding invitation.”</p><p>Max grinned, “Of course.” </p><p>Walter leaned down and kissed Max’s cheek: “Goodbye, Max.”</p><p>“Goodbye, Walter,” Max said.</p><p>The door opened. Walter stepped out. The door closed. And Max flopped onto the couch. Sprawled out over Liesel.</p><p>“I invited Walter to our wedding,” Max mumbled into Liesel’s stomach.</p><p>“I know,” Liesel said, threading her cold fingers through Max’s feathery hair.</p><p>“Is that okay?”</p><p>“<em> Ja </em>- yes, Max,” Liesel whispered into his hair, “of course it’s okay.” </p><p> </p><p align="center">
