  <p>"I love your Ms. Marvel." Afreen turned around. A woman in a Tardis dress waved at her as she shuffled in the opposite direction in the Hall H line. They'd meet again as the line folded its way back and forth under the tents protecting them from the humid sun.</p>
<p>Afreen fingered a fold of her head scarf. Technically, she shouldn't be wearing it. But it wasn't a costume piece. The black mask and the Ms. Marvel shirt and the leggings. Those were part of her costume. The scarf was not cosplay. </p>
<p>It was simply part of who she was.</p>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Blue Fanny pack or yellow fanny pack. Decisions. Decisions. Why was it called a fanny pack? Wearing it on your back was asking for it to be pick pocketed. Plus, harder to get what she needed when infiltrating an evil lair.</p><p>Kamala Khan examined the yellow one. It was bright. It stood out. It also had a ring that she could attach things to, which would be useful in a fight. She'd been reading comics since forever and if she'd learned one thing, it was superheroes should attach the tools that they really needed to bungee cords.</p><p>Definitely the yellow.</p></blockquote>
