      <p>This was all Peeta's idea. I didn't want to do it. Not like this anyway. But Peeta can always come up with some way to convince me of doing things I never even knew I wanted.</p><p>It's how we ended up having sex the car once.</p><p>Or sneaking off at Finnick and Annie's wedding to make out in a coat closet.</p><p>Or the time he got me to go sky diving when I would rather have endured a root canal without pain killers.</p><p>But a baby announcement is something big. And I wanted to do it quietly. Just call our family and friends and let Prim plan the biggest, most elaborate baby shower imaginable.</p><p>My husband, on the other hand, got it into his head that we needed to do a cute little photo shoot and post the pictures on Facebook.</p><p>That's how I ended up here in the kitchen, wearing a frilly apron, and making goofy faces at a camera Peeta set up on the opposite counter.</p><p>"Why can't we just take pictures of a cheese bun in the oven?" I asked as hour two rolls around. "I don't look good in this and I've already run out of the room three times to throw up."</p><p>Peeta straightens up from the camera, a pout forming on his cute lips. There is something about the pregnancy hormones that had made me want him even more lately. I want to kiss that pout right off his face.</p><p>If I didn't also feel the need to empty the non-existent contents of my stomach for the thousandth time.</p><p>"Fine." Peeta sighs.</p><p>"And now I've made you mad." I huff as I cross my arms and lean against the counter.</p><p>"No, you haven't." He says, his voice clipped short. He walks around the counter, places the cheese bun in the oven, snaps a few pictures and turns off the camera. "Better?"</p><p>I groan and open my mouth to say something, but he pulls me close for a deep kiss.</p><p>"I'm just so happy, Katniss." He murmurs between kisses.</p><p>"I know you are." I say. "And I am, too. I just feel gross." I bury my fingers in his hair. "Can I take these clothes off yet?"</p><p>"Let me take them off for you." He lifts me up into his strong arms and carries me up to our room. "I'll post that picture later."</p><p>"We should probably call my mom first." I suggest as he lays me out on the bed.</p><p>"We will, but before thatâ€¦" He stretches out over me and kisses me softly. Time to celebrate the baby again. And again and again.</p>
