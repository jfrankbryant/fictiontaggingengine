    <h1>I need you to stay, I want you to leave</h1>
    <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="http://archiveofourown.org/users/Rainydaysunrise/pseuds/Rainydaysunrise">Rainydaysunrise</a></div>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Bathtime.</p>
<p>Sacred time. Peace. Quiet. The only time when nobody would walk in on him smoking a joint in a tub full of bubbles.</p>
<p>Sweet peace.</p>
<p>He inhaled deeply and then watched as the cloud of white smoke left his lungs. </p>
<p>"Hey." </p>
<p>Ben was in the bedroom, unseen and seeming to respect his privacy.</p>
<p>After all, rehab gave you a sense of never feeling like you'd be alone again.</p>
<p>Especially if you proved yourself to be a danger.</p>
<p>Which Klaus was.</p>
<p>Always.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hey guys! I hope you have a great day and thank you for reading! </p>
<p>I really like writing for Umbrella Academy. I found a bunch of Vanya fics I wrote when I was in school today and I might post them or I might just keep them for myself. We'll see xD</p>
<p>Thank you again!</p></blockquote>

    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Bathtime.</p>
<p>Sacred time. Peace. Quiet. The only time when nobody would walk in on him smoking a joint in a tub full of bubbles.</p>
<p>Sweet peace.</p>
<p>He inhaled deeply and then watched as the cloud of white smoke left his lungs. </p>
<p>"Hey." </p>
<p>Ben was in the bedroom, unseen and seeming to respect his privacy.</p>
<p>After all, rehab gave you a sense of never feeling like you'd be alone again.</p>
<p>Especially if you proved yourself to be a danger.</p>
<p>Which Klaus was.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>All day.</p>
<p>Klaus put out the joint in the ashtray and slipped his head underwater.</p>
<p>He counted the breaths.</p>
<p>How long it would be or could be until he needed to resurface.</p>
<p>One... "Klaus."</p>
<p>Two... "Klaus."</p>
<p>Three... "Klaus."</p>
<p>Four... "KLAUS."</p>
<p>The screams got louder. </p>
<p>Five... "WHY DID YOU LEAVE US?"</p>
<p>Six... "WHY AREN'T YOU HELPING?" </p>
<p>Seven... "YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MY HAPPY ENDING." </p>
<p>He shot out of the water. </p>
<p>Dave.</p>
<p>It had been Dave's voice.</p>
<p>A sob ripped its way out of him. </p>
<p>"Ben?!" He yelled, the apartment felt unbelievably empty.</p>
<p>He shouted again, and again until Ben came into the room. </p>
<p>His brothers eyes were sympathetic. </p>
<p>"Did you see him again...?" Ben's cold hands were on his back, solid but not. </p>
<p>It felt like icy wind chilling his spine as he nodded.</p>
<p>"I want Diego..." </p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"I just want to go home."</p>
<p>"You are home, Klaus..."</p>
<p>Klaus let out a humorless laugh as he looked around at his bathroom. It was the prettiest part of his home.</p>
<p>"No place like home, I guess." </p>
<p>"Are you high?" </p>
<p>"Getting there..." </p>
<p>"Do you need me?"</p>
<p>The brunette looked at him with huge brown eyes.</p>
<p>"Please, stay..." It was a plea, a cry for help, and Ben, while he was dead would not leave him to face the demons alone.</p>
<p>Besides, it's not like he had anything to do tonight anyways.</p>
<p>"I'm here."</p>
