    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Hermann had been in the waiting room for nearly an hour when Newt finally shuffled in, one hand clutching an icepack to his jaw and the other holding the nurse’s arm.</p><p>‘Oh, good.’ He hurried over, struggling to hide his worry. ‘Newton, how are you feeling?’</p><p>Newt stared back at him with a look of betrayal. ‘They took my teeth, dude,’ he slurred.</p><p>‘Not all of them,’ the nurse said kindly, ‘just the ones that were causing you trouble.’</p><p>Newt had been complaining about his wisdom teeth for as long as Hermann had known him. “I’ll get it fixed when the apocalypse is over,” he’d insist whenever Hermann nagged him about it. Ten years later, the apocalypse was over and Newt was out of excuses.</p><p>‘Can we go home now?’ Newt let go of the nurse’s arm and latched onto Hermann like a dejected limpet. With a sigh, Hermann settled things with the nurse and listened to her instructions. It was a little hard to concentrate with Newt being so… affectionate. Judging by her smile, she noticed his blush.</p><p>It was dark outside. Mako waved from her car. ‘Did it go well?’ she asked as they clambered into the back.</p><p>‘No, it was bad,’ Newt muttered, clutching the icepack against his cheek. ‘Didn’t feel any of the teeth come out.’</p><p>‘That is a <em>good</em> thing, Newton.’ Hermann leaned over to buckle him in.</p><p>‘But I don’t know if they even did it!’</p><p>Mako laughed. ‘I’ll get you home.’</p><p>“Home” was still the Shatterdome for now, although clean-up had begun and pretty soon the K-Science division would be a thing of the past. Hermann never thought he’d miss that lab – or his annoying co-worker. As they turned a corner, Newt slumped against his shoulder. Hermann put an arm around him.</p><p>‘Had really cool dreams.’ Newt mumbled. ‘Each dentist was a different Kaiju…’</p><p>In the mirror, Mako’s eyes flicked up briefly before returning to the road. A Kaiju had taken her father, just as it had taken her family before it. He knew she was still grieving, in her own quiet way. ‘How many dentists were there?’ she asked, incredulously.</p><p>‘A family,’ Newt pronounced, eyes slipping closed. Without his glasses, he looked more vulnerable somehow. Hermann could see the line across his forehead where the stitches had recently healed, the yellow stain of a bruise on his cheekbone. He resisted the urge to comb his fingers through his messy hair.</p><p>Back at the Shatterdome, Mako helped Newt to walk up to his room. He wobbled along amiably enough, but when he started bumping into things Hermann quickly returned his glasses.</p><p>Outside his door, Newt fumbled through his pockets. ‘I… I can’t find my key. Maybe I left it inside…’</p><p>Hermann’s heart sank. Newt had changed his mind about going five times, until he’d had to almost drag him out the door. The key was probably inside his room.</p><p>Mako bit her lip. ‘You could borrow my room for the night? I’ve been sharing with Raleigh anyway.’ She blushed a little.</p><p>Hermann shook his head it. ‘Mako, you have done more than enough tonight. I’ll… I’ll take him to my quarters. It’s probably better if someone keeps an eye on him, anyway.’</p><p>Mako hesitated. 'Are you sure? I really don't mind...'</p><p>Newt looked to Hermann hopefully. 'Sleepover? Please?'</p><p>Oh, it was going to be a long night.</p><p>Mako followed them to Hermann's room then bid them goodnight.</p><p>'Take care, rock star,' she said fondly, with a wink at Newt.</p><p>'Mmm,' said Newt vaguely, eyes drifting closed.</p><p>Hermann ambled into his apartment, scanning for any litter or discarded underwear before remembering that he never left anything in his room out of place.</p><p>Newt sat down on Hermann's bed, groaned and promptly spat a mouthful of bloody gauze into his lap.</p><p>'Oh, for heaven's sake, Newton.' Hermann grabbed a handkerchief and cleaned up the mess.</p><p>'Hurts,' Newt said miserably, but held still as Hermann gently mopped the red saliva off his fingers and chin. 'Are you sure they took my teeth out?'</p><p>'I assure you that they took all four of your wisdom teeth, yes.'</p><p>'Where did they put them?' He stared at him tiredly, icepack pressed against his cheek again. 'They're my teeth. So I own them.'</p><p>'You can't keep them. If it's any consolation, you have plenty more.'</p><p>'But I had them for so long,' he whined, flopping down on Hermann's pillow. 'I saved the world with those teeth!'</p><p>With a sigh, Hermann patted his ankle. Sometimes he thought he could feel Newt’s emotions, like some residual effect of their Drift. Some mornings he woke up with a song in his head he'd never heard before. Like it or not, they were connected now.</p><p>Newt sighed softly as Hermann's hand found his shoulder. Hermann wasn't sure how it got there, but he couldn't bring himself to remove it. 'Get some rest,' he said finally. Newt did indeed seem to be dozing off, mumbling nonsense as Hermann relieved him of his glasses and shoes.</p><p>It would be hard to say goodbye to him, Hermann realised. At some point, their volatile relationship had morphed into something harder to define. He’d told himself it was merely co-dependency from working together for so long, but that didn’t account for their Drift. He’d been inside Newt’s head, and he knew that there was something there too.</p><p>Newt appeared to be asleep by the time Hermann draped the blanket over him, but then he stirred. 'I think I'm in love with you,' he said dreamily.</p><p>Hermann froze. 'It's only a blanket Newton, no need to be so dramatic.'</p><p>'You think I'm joking.' He looked so adorably sad, only his head visible above the blanket. 'You always think I'm joking when I say nice things. But I do love you.'</p><p>Hermann looked back at him, and for a moment they were standing together in the pouring rain, minds reeling from the Drift. ‘I – that’s very nice of you. Please try to get some sleep.’ He couldn’t tell him. Not now, when Newt probably wouldn’t remember it, and not when they’d most likely be on opposite sides of the world in a week or two. It was easier to remain detached. That was how he’d been able to do his work in the first place. No ties.</p><p>‘Where are you going?’ Newt asked in alarm as Hermann turned away. ‘Don’t go! I’m sorry!’</p><p>‘I’m not going anywhere,’ he said. ‘I’m going to sleep on the sofa.’ He barely used the battered old couch by the window, but it would suffice for tonight.</p><p>‘There’s enough room for two, you know.’ Newt patted the space beside him. ‘Your leg hurts, doesn’t it? I can feel it too.’</p><p>Indeed, Hermann’s leg had been throbbing for most of the walk back. He gaped at him. ‘You can?’</p><p>‘You’re so cute when you’re all uptight. Come on. Please?’</p><p>If they’d been in this situation a month ago, Hermann would have probably marched out and slept in Mako’s room. Perhaps a little bit of Newt had rubbed off on him in the Drift, because he found himself shrugging off his jacket, kicking off his shoes and climbing into bed beside him. He switched off the light. Now, only a faint glow came from under the door.</p><p>Newt curled up under the blanket, squishing his face into the pillow. ‘This is nice,’ he sighed.</p><p>Hermann dared to shuffle a little closer, not quite touching him but close enough to feel Newt’s warmth. ‘Yes, it is.’</p><p>There was an itch under his skin, a yearning. He didn’t want to say goodbye, not after all they’d been through. Would he still feel the effects of their Drift when they were far apart? What if Newt got into trouble somehow, would he feel his pain? His loneliness?</p><p>‘Newton,’ he said quietly, ‘I – I don’t want you to leave.’</p><p>Newt yawned. ‘I’m not leaving, I’m staying here.’</p><p>‘I don’t mean this room. I mean you. I don’t want to go back to sending letters.’</p><p>There was a silence so long that Hermann was sure Newt had gone to sleep. But then Newt shuffled over until his forehead rested on his shoulder. ‘I don’t want you to leave either.’</p><p>Relief flooded through him, so strong that he was sure Newt would feel it. ‘It’s settled, then,’ Hermann said calmly, though his heart was singing. ‘Wherever we go next, we shall go together.’</p><p>The bed rustled as Newt fidgeted, then there was a puff of air on his cheek as Newt sighed. ‘I can’t kiss you ‘cause my mouth hurts.’</p><p>‘You can’t kiss me because you are full of drugs, you silly man.’ But when Newt rested his head on his chest, he didn’t complain. The icepack dripped cold water onto Hermann’s shirt. ‘So, Doctor Geiszler.’ Fondly, he ran his fingers through Newt’s hair. ‘Was this experience better or worse than drifting with a Kaiju brain?'</p><p>‘Better, ‘cause I get cuddles. S’not as cool, though.’</p><p>Hermann smiled into the darkness. ‘Tell me about these Kaiju dreams you had?’</p><p>‘Well, one of them was Otachi, which was funny because she has wings so she couldn’t hold any of the tools…’ As Newt spoke, a warm contentedness seeped through the both of them. Hermann had no idea what was going to happen next, but all that mattered was they did it together.</p><p>He didn’t need the Drift to know that he loved Newt too.</p>
