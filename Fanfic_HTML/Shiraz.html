    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>I sit on a floor cushion with Buttercup in my lap. There's a glass of Shiraz in my hand. I swirl the dark purple liquid around as I watch them. My lovers.<br/>
Finnick and Peeta are sitting upright on the couch, each sipping their own glasses of wine. Katniss lies across them, with her head in Finnick's lap and her feet in Peeta's. A purple throw blanket is draped over their bodies, wrapping them in luxury. They look like a prize, my prize, though I'm not sure what I've done to deserve them.<br/>
It's funny how the dynamics of a relationship settle. Each person seems to fall into a specific role. It’s been true in my previous relationships, with individual men and women, and it’s true now, too.<br/>
Peeta is adventurous, always trying to break us out of our shells, though he's still quick to retreat into his. Finnick is supportive, and leads by example, which sometimes gets him into trouble. Katniss is practical, keeping us all grounded. And me, I'm the optimist. The one who thinks that no matter what, everything will be okay. Even when I know in my heart that it can't be.<br/>
What we have is lightening in a bottle, and I don't know how long we can keep it contained.<br/>
Katniss and Finnick are discussing one of the graphic novels they like to read, while I try not to roll my eyes.<br/>
“That’s not even anatomically possible,” Katniss says, pointing to the section in the book that Finnick just showed her.<br/>
“Oh yeah?” Finnick answers, laughter in his voice. “Says who?”<br/>
“Says me!" Katniss knocks against his hand and a few drops of wine spill onto the blanket. That stain won't show though. "The only one here with a Masters in Biology.”<br/>
“Don't wave your fancy degree at me," Finnick teases. "We’re not talking about ecosystems or zoo-ology here."<br/>
"You mean zoology?" Katniss smirks up at him.<br/>
"Last time I checked, you’re neither an OBGYN nor a porn star, so your word does not outweigh mine when it comes to the graphic part of graphic novels. I say it’s possible.”<br/>
“So now you’re comparing OBGYNs to porn stars?” Peeta laughs. Peeta and I don't read those shitty books that pretend to be novels, but he's hanging onto their every word anyway.<br/>
“Well, I do think their areas of expertise overlap in certain… areas.” My husband wiggles his eyebrows. “Wanna try it? I can prove it to you.” He has unbraided Katniss's hair and is threading his fingers through it.<br/>
She laughs, but doesn’t answer. Katniss always needs some time to warm up to new ideas in the bedroom. But she usually does.<br/>
"Maybe," she teases.<br/>
Peeta strokes her ankles gently, lovingly, while he studies her face as she smiles up at Finnick. He looks at her, and only at her.<br/>
That's when it becomes clear. I don’t know why I haven’t realized it before now. Or perhaps I have, I just haven’t allowed myself to acknowledge it?<br/>
Peeta loves her the most.<br/>
I know he loves me. Finnick, too. But, it's not the same. When I look at the way Peeta’s face is glowing as he looks at her, it’s almost painfully obvious.<br/>
I'd like to think that we all love each other equally, but maybe that's not possible? We entered this as two married couples. Two separate entities, who had already made vows to love honor and obey one other person, until death do us part. Since then, we’ve torn down the walls. We have created something new. No boundaries. Well... There aren't supposed to be any boundaries, anyway.<br/>
Late one night, when it was just the two of us, Finnick told me that in his mind, his vows – our vows - have expanded to include Katniss and Peeta, even if it’s not legally possible. And perhaps that's how I feel too.<br/>
But I'd be lying if I said I thought they felt the same. At the end of this life, it will be Katniss and Peeta. It has to be. Anything else in unthinkable.<br/>
But where does that leave us?</p>
