      <p>Howl poked at the fireplace with the poker, stirring the coals and turning them over until their glowing red insides showed amongst the black and grey ashes.</p><p>A slight fizz and a cloud of soot was his only warning before the flames burst up.</p><p>"Welcome back," he said, throwing Calcifer a log.</p><p>Calcifer absorbed the log eagerly. "It's raining out there," he said, resentfully.</p><p>"I know," said Howl. He put the poker aside.</p><p>"Where's Sophie?"</p><p>"Fabric shopping with Martha," he said. "Again."</p><p>Calcifer crackled sympathetically. "I thought she was done?"</p><p>"Apparently that was just the petticoats," said Howl. "I will never understand women's dresses."</p><p>The fire demon fizzed a little in agreement. "You can do six impossible things before breakfast, but you can't solve the mystery of the female mind," he observed.</p><p>"And it wouldn't be so bad," said Howl, resentfully, "but she just sews and sews and sews and she doesn't say anything, when I know she has to be thinking about it!"</p><p>Calcifer flickered in agreement. "I've seen her at it."</p><p>"And she keeps asking questions about what kind of magic she should be sewing into the dress! I tell her the usual - happiness, good fortune, but she keeps coming up with more."</p><p>"Better than the alternative," said Calcifer.</p><p>"That's true, at least she's thinking it through."</p><p>The castle door flew open, and Sophie came in, shedding umbrella and water-proof cloak (Howl's creation) in the stairwell. In her arms she carried swathes of white, silver and blue fabric.</p><p>"Sophie," called Howl, as she bustled towards her sewing room (formerly half of Howl's workroom, and sometimes he missed it), "what colour should I have my hair for the wedding?"</p><p>She looked at him for a moment. "Silver," she said, shortly, and disappeared behind the door.</p><p>Howl pulled a lock of dark hair in front of his eyes. "At least with silver hair I might get some respect for once."</p><p>Calcifer popped impolitely and gobbled up another log.</p><p>"In many ways this was a lot easier when you had my heart, old friend," said Howl, leaning his chin on his hand wistfully.</p><p>"I don't miss it," said Calcifer. "It's heavy stuff, having a heart."</p><p>Howl smiled slightly.</p><p>The workroom door opened again and Sophie's head appeared. "Howl," she said, "do you think it's safe to wish for faithfulness?"</p><p>He hesitated. "People do change sometimes," said Howl, doubtfully. "You wouldn't want to trap them."</p><p>Sophie huffed at him, and closed the door forcefully.</p><p>He felt Calcifer's eyes on him. "Well, what was I supposed to say?" he protested.</p><p>"Michael is your friend too," said the fire demon.</p><p>"All the more reason not to put shackles on him," said Howl, matter-of-fact.</p><p>Calcifer didn't look convinced, and Howl began to feel a little guilty.</p><p>"I stand by what I said, though, you shouldn't be using magic to enforce magical changes in personality on people, or to reduce personal freedom," Howl began.</p><p>Calcifer didn't say anything.</p><p>"Do you think I should..."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Will she-"</p><p>"You may want to hide your favourite suit," said Calcifer. "Just in case."</p><p>Howl winced.</p>
