      <p>They may not work well together in my mind, but when they're in my body it's a different story.</p><p>It all started when we needed an out. All three of us. We needed a release. Something to take our minds off of all the stress—the Hunger Games, the rebellion.</p><p>Peeta came to me first. In all actuality, the first night was on the train. It was magical. Fantastic. I had never felt anything better than that until then.</p><p>I could feel him. All of him.</p><p>All of his emotions were radiating off of ever part of his body. His eyes, his hands—Oh his hands…</p><p>I could feel his hands—his fantastic, huge, baker's hands that can handle even the most delicate of objects with such precision—and they made me want to scream. And I did. I screamed louder than I ever had.</p><p>I had finally found something that I could hold onto. And I did. I held onto him as if my life depended on it.</p><p>We both got our release that night. To this day, I will never regret it.</p><p>It lasted for only a month though before our lustful desires had to be sated again. At least, mine did.</p><p>That was when I went looking for Gale.</p><p>I went to our spot in the woods and looked for him everywhere. It was impossible to find him.</p><p>Until I heard his voice.</p><p>I followed the musical sound—a sound that was making every part of me weep.</p><p>I needed him. I needed to feel his hands on me. I needed to feel everything from the one man that had been with me from the beginning.</p><p>Good hunting partners are hard to find.</p><p>But I did find him.</p><p>With Peeta.</p><p>Apparently, their affair had been going on for longer than I could have even thought. I never thought that the two men in my life that had my mind doing flips and my stomach doing turns for were enjoying the same release that I had only found with Peeta only once.</p><p>I watched them in uncontrollable fascination. Peeta's hands were all over Gale's beautiful torso, those hands that had once been over me.</p><p>Gale's mouth, a mouth that I once held a curious allure for was all over Peeta's crafted body.</p><p>It made me ache more than I cared to admit.</p><p>When they finished their exertions, I was completely done for. There was no hope for me. I was in need.</p><p>I ran away afraid that they would try to shield me from their love affair—afraid that they would try to cover it up.</p><p>I ran to my home. Well, my house in Victors Village. I still haven't ever been able to call that my home. It has never felt like it.</p><p>Until they came.</p><p>They knew I was watching. They knew I knew about them.</p><p>And they knew I needed them.</p><p>So they came.</p><p>And I came.</p><p>It was wonderful and fantastic.</p><p>It was better than just being with Peeta.</p><p>And now we come to the point I'm at right now.</p><p>In bed between the loves of my life.</p><p>I could stay here forever.</p><p>But unfortunately, there is a war. And I am the Mockingjay.</p><p>And Gale is my cousin—at least, so everyone thinks…</p><p>There can't be a three person relationship including the savior of all of Panem. Or so I'm supposed to be.</p><p>Even though they won't let me do a damn thing.</p><p>I hate district 13.</p>
