</div>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Hecate listened for a moment, glossy black nails hovering over the translucent purple plastic on Pippa’s bureau.</p><p>Carefully unfolding the arms of the glasses—fearing every motion she would make would somehow break them or cause catastrophe—she raised them to her face.</p><p>A glance in the mirror told her they did not look as ill-fitting as they felt. She practised looking over the lenses at herself.</p><p>“Hecate, have you seen—?”</p><p>Pippa’s voice faltered.</p><p>“Sorry, I do not know what I was thinking—”</p><p>Pippa caught Hecate’s hand as she made to remove them and silenced her words with a kiss.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>“Put the potatoes over there, dear.”</p>
<p>Hecate obligingly levitated the bulging sack of potatoes into the pantry. The cottage they had rented for the long weekend was homely—just what they needed for Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>“Do you think it will rain today, Ada?”</p>
<p>Ada bustled over and joined her by the kitchen window, and looked out at the bright countryside.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it should,” Hecate said. She produced a potion bottle from her cloak and uncorked a sudden downpour outside. “We simply must spend all day indoors.”</p>
<p>Ada smiled knowingly. “I like that idea very much.”</p>

  <p>Dimity swore colourfully as a cascade of chanting music fluttered to the floor.</p><p>Footsteps sounded in the corridor. Dimity prayed it wasn’t a student, if only because of the new vocab she’d just introduced to them.</p><p>“Dimity— let me help you.” </p><p>There was no mistaking that Welsh lilt. Arabella crouched and gathered the fallen papers. “You’re literally the last person I want help from.”</p><p>“I know. I aim to change that.”</p><p>Dimity’s frown softened. “Why would you do that?”</p><p>“Because, Dimity, I’m sorry for— everything, but I’m here now.”</p><p>“You mean it?”</p><p>The sudden embrace was the answer she sought.</p>

  <p>As soon as the first notes slid into Pippa’s hearing, she pinked with embarrassment and got to her feet to change the song.</p><p>
  <i>Play us a song we can slow dance on—</i>
</p><p>“What is this song called?”</p><p>“Oh, it’s just a guilty pleasure really—it’s called Touch Me When We’re Dancing, by The Carpenters.” Pippa blushed. “The dangers of having shuffle on.”</p><p>“Wait—”</p><p>Hecate stepped into Pippa’s space and, slipping her hand around her lower waist, drew her closer, letting their hips press together.</p><p>“May I have this dance, Miss Pentangle?”</p><p>Pippa knew she could never resist that silken voice.</p>

  <p>“Good morning, Miss Drill,” Hecate said to the recumbent form on Julie’s sagging sofa, crouching as she held a mug of black coffee.</p><p>They had had quite an evening of wine and cheese for what Julie had referred to as “Galentine’s Day”, and Pippa insisted on a sleepover.</p><p>Dimity eyes widened. “Coffee. Just the way I like it.”</p><p>“Sometimes I pay attention.”</p><p>“Oh I love you,” Dimity sighed, more to the coffee than Hecate.</p><p>Hecate leaned against the sofa, but froze as a hand stroked her hair. “Are you still drunk?”</p><p>“Possibly.”</p><p>Hecate closed her eyes, deciding to enjoy it.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">Fancy That</h2>


</div>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>“Surprise!”</p><p>Hecate blinked at the potted plant addressing her from the doorway.</p><p>“Happy Valentine’s Day, love.” A head of curly blonde hair peeked out from the fronds. “I took the day off work. Ada told me she’s covering all your lessons.”</p><p>Of course Ada had orchestrated this. Julie set the pot down. “Did you receive my card?”</p><p>“I did. Thank you, love.” Julie pressed a kiss to her cheek. “We can spend the whole day together, unless you had other plans?”</p><p>“Somehow, my schedule is quite empty.” </p><p>“Fancy that,” Julie smirked.</p><p>Grateful—overwhelmed—Hecate let herself melt into Julie’s arms.</p>

  <p>Hecate looked at Jennifer, swathed in a honey-gold scarf, and could have swooned. They had taken a trip to Hay-on-Wye, and were in the midst of navigating precarious shelves of books in a cramped bookshop.</p><p>Jennifer pressed a thick volume into Hecate’s hands. “This is a favourite. I’d love you to read it when you have time.”</p><p>Hecate nodded, admiring the sincerity in her eyes behind her glasses. Jennifer’s taste in literature had never failed her.</p><p>“We’ll have to come back in the summer for the book festival.”</p><p>“I would like that very much.” Hecate glowed, and kissed her cheek.</p>
