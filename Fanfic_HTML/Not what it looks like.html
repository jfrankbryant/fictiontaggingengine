  <span>After their last mission had left the team in
shambles, the Champions
had decided to take a break, relax and recharge for a few days at
Viv’s house,
just between themselves. It wasn’t something they used to do
on a regular basis
– quite frankly, it was the opposite of their philosophy
– but between Riri’s
flashbacks to when she had been almost killed by Thanos, and
Sam’s recent hospitalization
after he had tried to save his friends despite being powerless, they
felt they deserved
being just teenagers even if for a short while.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Riri herself had vacated the dining room earlier,
claiming she wasn’t
hungry, and retreated to one of the bedroom; she was sitting on
“her” bed,
hugging a pillow with steamy hands as she watched the TV, shivering and
<span> </span>sweating as she held
her breath. she felt like
time wasn’t passing at all, and that the actors on the screen
were moving on
slow motion, like in Matrix.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“So, Zoe told me that Bruno told her that
he thought I was being selfish
because….”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“IT’S STAR TREK DISCOVERY!
I’M WATCHING STAR TREK DISCOVERY! IT’S JUST
THAT!” Riri jumped frantically from her spot on the bed and
hid the TV screen
with her whole body, as Kamala and Nadia lifted their eyebrows,
quizzically. </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Uh, Riri, it doesn’t sound a
lot like Star Trek….” Kamala extended her
neck, and stared, with eyes wide open, when she saw the unmistakable
figures on
the screen. </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>It was <i>Meredith Grey. </i>From
Grey’s Anatomy. Riri Williams, genius extraordinaire, and
armored super-hero,
was watching Grey’s Anatomy – a medical soap-opera.
</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Yes, fine, I love Grey’s
Anatomy! You just found out my secret!” Riri
practically screamed, blushing and pouting. She went to turn off the
TV, but
Kamala stopped her, and both she and Nadia went to seat on the bed, and
patted
the soft <span> </span>pillows
for Riri to join them
once again.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“So… who is Meredith dating,
then, Link or Andrew? And more important…. Did
she give any of them a Mc Nickname yet?” Nadia asked, and as
she said so, all
three girls collapsed into giggles, having fun over the shared guilty
pleasure.
