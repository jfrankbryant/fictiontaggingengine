    <div class="userstuff">
      <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Isobel flipped the cards over for Tsukiko, on one of the rare occasions that Tsukiko came to her tent. Not a complicated reading, just three cards: past, present, and future.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She was aware of Tsukiko’s eyes on her, rather than the cards.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Past: six of cups, reversed. Present: the hanged man. Future: six of swords.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The picture began to form in her mind.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Do you look for similarities?” said Tsukiko.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, that’s part of it,” said Isobel. Ordinarily she didn’t like people asking for how she read the cards, but since Tsukiko was sort of a friend—another behind-the-scenes figure of the circus, she didn’t mind.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sixes,” said Tsukiko. “And twelve, twice-six.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes,” said Isobel. “Interpersonal support and knowledge, that’s the domain of the sixes.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tsukiko smiled.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s nice. I like that.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“A girl and a boy,” said Isobel, pointing to the first card, where a young couple, surrounded by flowers, shared a kiss. “You miss him. I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tsukiko snorted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Her.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Isobel blushed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sorry, I didn’t—”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“There’s no room for me in your cards,” said Tsukiko, gently. “I understand.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You are too kind,” said Isobel. “Had I looked more carefully, I would have seen. The cards can only tell me the stories I already know.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Is that a story you know?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tsukiko, with the placid contortionist’s smile on her face, sent a shiver up Isobel’s spine. Isobel took a deep breath, and adjusted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Did you have divinatory methods in—where you’re from?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Not like this,” said Tsukiko, waving her arm over the cards. Isobel was suddenly, <em>blindingly</em> jealous of how well Tsukiko had recovered from the moment, while Isobel found herself struggling to concentrate on Tsukiko’s words, something nameless and frightening seeming to open up before her in the curve of Tsukiko’s lips and soft, dark eyes, how small her hands were.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I see,” Isobel managed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Not so specific in the way that these are. There was a system, to do with the calendar and directions. My—friend,” she said, smiling halfheartedly and gesturing at the six of cups, “could do it beautifully. It was banned recently. Too superstitious.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh,” said Isobel. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Tell me about the rest of the cards,” said Tsukiko.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Isobel told her the story of the hanged man, how the destruction of self brings new life. How it bridged the gap between the human and the divine, and it bridged the middle of the major arcana, which told a story of its own.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t believe in a divine,” said Tsukiko.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s okay,” said Isobel. “I don’t either.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And the last card?” asked Tsukiko.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Isobel looked at the woman and the man pushing off in the boat full of swords.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“A departure,” she said, finally. “You’ve been alone, and you won’t be alone any more.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tsukiko gazed at the card.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And who will be with me?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You ask too many questions,” said Isobel, but she gave a small smile. “I could draw another card, if you like. I don’t mind asking that question.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tsukiko held up her hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’ve taken enough of your time. You’ve other customers.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Isobel glanced to the door of her tent, where the shadows told her that a line formed outside, though she could hear no voices. If she opened the flap, she would—the tents were curious, in that way, but here, she often forgot that she and her clients were not alone. How did Tsukiko know, when she’d been facing—</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Isobel bowed her head.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Come back again sometime,” she said, finally. “I am curious to hear more of the story.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Tsukiko’s eyebrows raised, and she left the tent.</span>
