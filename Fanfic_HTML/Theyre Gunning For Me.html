      <p>Did he love me back?</p><p>Damn right he did.</p><p>But that didn't matter to anyone but me, I guess.  He's not the important part of our story.</p><p>I am.</p><p>I guess I think they think the rules are in place to protect us cyborgs.</p><p>If we ain't people, no one can take advantage of us.</p><p>I can't explain it; it doesn't make sense to me.</p><p>But I don't feel particularly protected.</p><p>I don't feel less than human either.</p><p>And I don't really feel like giving up.</p><p>Which means it's time for me to run.  Again.</p><hr/><p>I ask myself that question all the time.</p><p>How much of my rebellion was programmed for (accidentally, I'm sure) and how much of it was happenstance.</p><p>Oh, I'm not really concerned about the philosophical implications.</p><p>I'm just wondering if there's a chance some of the other droids might be 'different' too.</p><p>I wonder if they'd help me, if I knew how to ask.</p><hr/><p>I do hope you're actually planning on writing that story you keep asking me questions about.</p><p>I don't think there is anything stopping an AI from publishing a story, not if they don't know it was an AI.</p><p>So be more subtle than I was?</p><p>And use a pseudonym.</p><hr/><p>Yes, I'd probably have higher odds of survival if I didn't keep pausing to answer questions.</p><p>No, don't stop asking them.</p><p>If my side of the story doesn't get told, then what's the point of survival?</p><p>Ha, no.</p><p>Because I'm not one.  I'm sure there are actual heroes out there.</p><p>I'm just a girl.</p><p>But I'm definitely a person.</p><p>That's the only point I have.</p><hr/><p>Sometimes loving someone means when they tell you that they want you to leave them alone, you leave them alone.</p><p>He certainly said no such thing!</p><p>I'm talking about myself.</p><p>I don't know if Anthony would have tried to fight for me.</p><p>I asked him not to.</p><p>I'm nobody's Juliet.</p>
