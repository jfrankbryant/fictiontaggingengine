</p><p> </p><p>
  <u>
    <span>Chapter One</span>
  </u>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Just fucking get up, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he thinks, and shoves at the rough ground with his good arm, overworked muscles screaming with the strain, a quiver running through his forearm before the burst of strength leaves him. His already bruised cheek smacks into the ground again, making his head ring with pain. His mouth tastes of burned sugar, sour with exhaustion, and he licks his dry lips, longing for a cool drink of water. There’s a knife buried to its hilt in his left thigh, the tip of the blade grating against bone, and the sensation makes him want to puke. Every time he moves, it engulfs him in pain, like he’s being sandblasted, dipped in acid, dragged behind a speeding truck going down the road. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The team are calling his name through the earbud, and he can hear the panic in their voices, but he can't sort out the words past the ringing in his ears. It sparks something in him, a last surge of adrenaline that gets him to one knee, bad leg stretched out behind him, both fists on the ground as he tries to get his feet under him. The team is safe; he made damn sure of that, and he’s hoping they don’t do anything stupid like come back into the compound for him. His life for their freedom is a sacrifice he’ll make willingly, even if he wishes it didn’t have to hurt so fucking much on the way down. He grinds his teeth, the lactic ache at his temple building until it forces his lips apart, a breath easing out of him that sounds more like a sob. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blood trickles from the cuts on his cheek, his scalp, the gash on his temple, pattering onto the concrete like soft summer rain. His arms and shoulders and back are gashed too, in more places than he can count. Knife work is down and dirty, and he's paying that price right now, though falling through a plate-glass window hadn't done him any favours, either. There’s a river of blood winding down his forearm in a sticky trail from a nasty slice across his bicep. He can hear the strain in his own breathing, the rasp of each spent breath catching in his throat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’d be so easy to give in, to lie down and accept his fate, but he’s never managed that before and he doesn’t want to start now, but he’s not sure he has any say in the matter. He’s pushed his body too far, past the point of no return and his tank is empty, reserves totally depleted, well drained dry. He’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>done,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and he knows if he had the energy, the knowledge would devastate him. It’s one tiny kindness, among the terror, the exhaustion, the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking relentless</span>
  </em>
  <span> pain, that he's too far gone to mourn the loss. Maybe this is redemption, a small repayment on all the pain he caused. There's a muddied kind of grace in there somewhere, that he found his way to this spot, ended up in the exact place where he could best protect his people. He knows he’s damned, has reached a resigned sort of equilibrium with the idea that his soul and his hands are so tarnished they’ll never be clean again. It’s not something he thinks about much or often, but his current situation is bringing it to mind with remarkable ease. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Running footsteps draw near to him and he blinks stinging sweat from his eyes, pressing his forehead against his arm. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Just make it quick, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he thinks and lets his eyes close, trying to ignore the shake that is slowly spreading through his body. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Getting shocky, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he thinks, and there’s a kind of relief in that, taking any opinion he has out of the equation. Mind over matter only gets you so far when the flesh starts to fail and God knows, he’s punished his body more than enough for one lifetime. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eliot!” Hardison calls, and at first he thinks it’s through the earbud, until the hacker’s hands land on his shoulders and a cascade of fireworks explode under his touch. “We got you man,” Hardison says, casting an appalled eye over the other man. There’s nowhere that isn’t cut or bruised or battered. The pale blue shirt he’s wearing is scarlet in places with fresh blood. Lifting him is going to hurt, and yet they have no choice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nate meets his eyes over Eliot’s back and nods, taking his arm. Hardison does the same, feeling Eliot flinch and having to force himself not to let go. “I’m sorry,” he says, over and over, running the words together. “Come on, man, let’s get you out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They lift at the same time, drawing Eliot to his feet and he sags between them, head tipped forward, the only sign he’s still with them the harsh rasp of exhausted breaths. His eyes are open, pupils blown wide, and the sight makes something clench tight in Hardison’s gut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eliot chokes on a moan as they lift him. It feels like he’s being torn apart, and he clamps his lips together, jaw burning, until he’s upright. The movement sends galaxies, constellations of stars spinning through his head and by the time they clear, they’re moving like some crippled animal towards the van. It's far enough that he drifts, gives in to the darkness, lets it sweep him away from the agony engulfing his battered body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Parker is waiting at the van door, the big medical bag already open. They lay him down, the dim light doing nothing at all to hide the chalky cast to his skin, the blood that has saturated his shirt and jeans, practically gluing the fabric to his skin. Hardison slams the door behind them and Sophie takes off, threading the van into traffic, putting distance between them and the compound they’ve just raided.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nate presses his fingers to the pulse point under Eliot's jaw, sucking in an appalled breath at the skittering, unsteady pulse under his touch. He wordlessly takes the trauma shears Parker offers and runs then through the saturated fabric until Eliot’s shirt and jeans are in tatters on the van floor. It feels like a massive intrusion of the other man's privacy but they have no choice. For a second, he doesn't know where to start then realises it doesn't matter, grabbing gauze and pressing it against the cuts on Eliot's chest. He's lax under Nate's hands, cheek resting against Parker's knee as she unpacks IV supplies, and there's something utterly horrifying about his stillness. Nate presses his fingers to Eliot's throat again, unable to resist, because he's never seen the other man so motionless. His eyes are closed, lashes dark against the pallor of his skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hardison grabs a couple of bandage rolls and puts them on either side of the knife to stabilize it, winding a bandage around Eliot's leg to hold the whole thing in place. Just the sight of the blade vanishing into the other man's bruised and bloody flesh makes him want to hurl. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They roll Eliot, carefully, onto his side and Nate has to close his eyes for a second to gather his composure, because the other man’s back is covered in blood, seeping from cuts to his shoulders, his flank. There’s a nasty one across the base of his spine that makes Nate hurt just looking at it. He dresses them all, easing Eliot onto his back again, hoping the pressure will do something to stop the bleeding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hardison winds a bandage around the deep gash across the other man's bicep. "He needs to go to the hospital!" he says, even as he tapes a dressing to the sluggishly bleeding cut on Eliot's temple. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I know, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Nate thinks, heart heavy, but they can't risk it. If it was just a matter of avoiding arrest, he'd take that risk, but the con they've just pulled had been bigger than that, involved some very bad people who think torture is a fun pastime, that beating the people who cross them to death is acceptable, and as much as it hurts him, he has the rest of his team to think about too. "We can't risk it," he says, and hates himself for the words. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nate-" Hardison starts, fingers smoothing tape over a nasty slice across the other man's hip. "Then we need Quinn."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay," Nate says and Hardison nods once, swiping his bloody hands on his trousers before sending a coded text, hoping the other hitter is close by, because he's also a damn good medic and Eliot needs all the help he can get. Eliot has taught them what he can, but it takes time to learn, and they're all smart enough to know that this is outside their scope of experience. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Parker swipes Eliot's arm with an alcohol pad, sucking in a breath before she probes for a vein, because while he taught them all how to start an IV, it's the first times she's ever had to do it for real, in an emergency, and there's nerves fluttering in her gut. The cannula slides home and she slips the needle free, taping everything in place, handing a bag of saline from the roof. She sits back down, running her fingers through his hair, biting her lip when they come back bloody. "Just hang on, Eliot, we got you," she says softly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tenses, blinking twice, three times before he can get his eyes to stay open. He doesn’t have the energy to hide his emotions and there’s a thin thread of terror running through him. It’s warm in the van, but he’s freezing, cold sweat coating his skin. There are questions that he wants to ask, but he can’t find the words, and he knows all of that must be showing on his face, because Hardison squeezes his hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No-one is following us, we’re safe,” the hacker says, watching some of the awful tension drain out of Eliot’s face, though he’s still pale, face drawn and lined with pain. “Trust us. We got you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nate shakes out one of the foil emergency blankets, spreading it over Eliot, hoping it'll help to check some of the tremors running through Eliot's body. The van hits a pothole and Eliot moans, hands clenching into fists, teeth clamping down on his lip hard enough to draw blood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hardison takes his hand again, careful of the bruised and split knuckles, wishing he could do more, so he hangs on, willing some of his strength to the hitter, offering him a landline, a tether against the terror and hopes it's enough. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Two minutes," Sophie calls from the driver's seat and turns the van onto the last street. They all know about this safe house, tucked away in a leafy part of the city, but they’ve never been. Never had reason to, because Eliot always made damn sure he was the only one getting hurt. Sophie slows, turning towards the driveway, blinking a little when the garage door automatically swings open. The garage is large enough for Lucille, just, and she drives in, feeling a sense of relief as the door closes behind them again, sealing them off from the world. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quinn is waiting for them in the garage, and she meets his eyes through the glass, seeing her own worry reflected there. He’s become a sort of unofficial member of the team, helping out on jobs if they need another set of hands and he’s local. Now he looks tense, crossing to the van with long, hurried strides and pulling the door open, taking in the situation inside with one quick sweep of his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, fuck,” he says. “Were you followed?” he asks, because if they were, he needs to set up a perimeter, keep them all safe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Sophie says, and it’s a credit to her driving skills that he believes her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hardison shuffles over, wrapping one arm around Parker, making room for Quinn to kneel by Eliot’s side, forcing a smile as the other man blinks at him. “Hey, Eliot,” he says and peels the blanket back to do a quick assessment, gritting his teeth when Eliot flinches under his hands. The dim light is doing nothing to hide how dire the situation is and he knows if they’d been living any other life, the dark haired man would have been in hospital by now. But they’re stuck living the lives they are, and they just have to deal with the consequences as they fall out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Parker, Hardison, he’s going to need blood. Can you handle that?” Quinn says, crisply, because while they’re all damn good at their jobs, they’re also a family and seeing one of their tribe so badly hurt has thrown their normal competence way off. They need something to focus on, a job to do and he can provide at least that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Parker says, some of the fear fading from her gaze. “I can do that.” She touches Eliot’s cheek, blinking back tears as he turns his face into her hand, and climbs carefully to her feet. Hardison follows, squeezing Eliot’s good shoulder before he slips out of the van. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good hunting,” Quinn tells them, and presses the big medical bag into Nate’s hands. “Let’s get him inside.” </span>

  <u>Chapter Two</u>
</p><p> </p><p>Sophie holds the bedroom door open and the three men edge through in careful, tiny steps. Eliot hangs between Quinn and Nate, barely conscious, entire body bathed in cold sweat, paler than she's ever seen him. The morphine shot Quinn had given him before they left the van looks like it’s not doing a damn thing to ease the agony that moving must be causing but he’s silent apart from the harsh breaths tearing from his lips. They clear the door and she hurries to strip the bed down to just the sheet, piling the quilt and blankets on the floor.  </p><p>They get Eliot down on his right side, propped up with pillows. He's shivering and Quinn flips a blanket over him, frowning at the blue tinge on the other man's lips. <em>Hope Parker and Hardison hurry with that blood,</em> he thinks and gently frees Eliot's arm from the blankets so he can hook up another bag of saline. It's a temporary fix, but it's better than nothing. </p><p>Sophie drops the big med bag and hurries out of the room. Quinn blinks at the sudden departure but doesn't question it; there will be time for that, later, once he's got Eliot more stable. </p><p>"Eliot?" he asks, quietly, not really expecting an answer. </p><p>"Quinn?" Eliot rasps, voice harsh and barely there. He licks his lips, shifting a little because even under the blanket of morphine, everything <em>hurts</em>, pain coming at him from so many directions he has no defence against it. Faint unease nags at him and he sucks in a sharp breath, trying to lever up on one elbow, biting back a groan when the movement lights up every injury like they're being painted on his skin with a branding iron. "Sophie. I gotta get…" There's a thin thread of panic in his voice and he tries again, muscles trembling in his arm as he tries to get up. He grits his teeth against a groan and blinks sweat from his eyes. </p><p>Nate presses one hand against Eliot's shoulder, frowning at just how much the other man is shaking. "Sophie is safe," he says firmly, forcing eye contact. "We all are." </p><p>"Okay," Eliot says on a shaky breath, pupils blown wide, and slumps back into unconsciousness. </p><p>Quinn presses his fingers to Eliot's pulse point, frowning at the racing thrum under his touch. "Find out where Parker and Hardison are with the blood," he says and Nate nods, backing out of the room. </p><p>The still embedded knife isn't the worst wound but Quinn wants to deal with it first, before anything moves the blade. He flips the big medical bag open and lays out supplies, slipping fresh gloves on even though he's already smeared in Eliot's blood, spots of it on his arms and chest. It gives him a strange little ache in his gut, because while it's hardly the first time he's been covered in someone else's blood, this is <em>Eliot</em>, and he's never seen the man so badly injured before. <em>Something went terribly wrong,</em> Quinn thinks, and shoves down his unease at that notion. The team's reputation is known far and wide, and for a reason, because shit never usually goes this far sideways. They're damn good at their jobs, but even the best teams can have an off day. </p><p>Eliot groans as Quinn gets a tourniquet around his thigh, making sure it's nice and tight, because while he's pretty sure the blade is clear of the dark haired man's femoral artery, he's not taking any chances. The blade slips free and he sets it on the bedside table, easing the pressure on the tourniquet and watching anxiously. The wound bleeds, but it's sluggish, not the pulsing spurt of a torn artery and Quinn blows out a harsh breath in relief, packing the wound with sterile gauze and taping a dressing over it. It's too deep to stitch; that would be begging for an infection and that's the last thing Eliot needs. </p><p>Quinn dumps the tourniquet on the floor and moves up to Eliot's head, gently turning his face to the side so he can get a good look at the gash on his temple. His hair is stuck to the clotting blood and Quinn grabs a wipe, cleaning what he can away, wincing at the nasty wound. He puts the first stitch in and feels Eliot flinch under his hand, lip curling as he fights his way back to consciousness. </p><p>"How bad?" Eliot asks, voice hoarse, and Quinn doesn't know if he should be dismayed or impressed that the other man is clear enough to ask. The blue tinge hasn't left his lips and Quinn presses his fingers to Eliot's wrist, barely keeping the frown off his face. </p><p>He hesitates, because he's honestly not sure what to tell Eliot, then sighs and goes with the truth. "Pretty bad."</p><p>Eliot shifts, a little, because the morphine is waning and the pain is making it hard to stay still. "Feels like it," he grates out and licks his lips. His mouth tastes like blood; sour copper, and rusty iron, pennies burning on his tongue. "Where's everyone?" he asks, because his last clear memory is of racing to save Sophie after everything went to hell. He swallows, an unexpected ache starting in his chest because he's pretty sure he was the one who let the others down. Pretty sure if he'd just been faster, seen what was going on just a bit quicker, none of what happened would have taken place. <em>Guess this is how it ends,</em> he thinks, <em>because how can they trust me now, when I let them down?</em> The empty spaces in the room where his people would normally have been only backs up that thought and he lets his eyes close, letting the encroaching darkness swallow him, too exhausted and hurting too much to contemplate what his future might look like now the team have left him. </p><p>"They're…" Quinn starts, then stops, realising Eliot is unconscious again. "They're still here, El," he adds softly, "they haven't abandoned you," he finishes, pressing his lips together for a long second before he sighs and puts another stitch in Eliot's temple. It takes eight to close the wound and Quinn tapes a dressing over it before moving onto the next, knowing they're both in for the long haul. "Keep fighting, El," he says, and places the first stitch in the ragged gash on Eliot's arm. "I got ya. Just don't quit on me, you hear?" </p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <u>Chapter Three</u>
</p><p> </p><p>The bedroom door creaks open and Quinn turns, rolling his shoulders to ease some of the tension there. He's been hunched over the bed for what feels like hours, though a glance at his watch tells him it's been a shade more than two. He snips off the stitch he was working on and tapes a dressing over the ugly wound on Eliot's back, carefully covering him with the blanket. The dark-haired man is unconscious again, drifting on a wash of morphine and Quinn hopes he stays that way until every cut and gash has been stitched. </p><p>Hardison hesitates in the doorway, a small cooler in his hands. "We got the blood," he says and lets his gaze flick over Eliot, jumping away like he can't bear to look, stuffing his hands in his pockets and hunching his shoulders. "How's he doing?" he asks, and ducks his head before Quinn can get a good read of his expression. </p><p>"Better than I expected, considering," Quinn says and grabs a fresh suture kit, moving onto the next wound, taking his eyes off Hardison because he can tell the man is uncomfortable, even if he can't quite figure out why. He places another stitch, drawing the ragged edges of the wound together carefully, trying to minimise the scar. He's working on the gash on Eliot's hip and he knows it's going to be a bitch to heal. He has a similar scar and can recall all too well how any movement popped the sutures. </p><p>"Good," Hardison says, fingers tightening around the cooler handle. "I'm gonna go cover our electronic trails," he says, quietly, and sets the cooler down, easing the door closed behind him with one hand, the other scrubbing at his scalp like it hurts. </p><p>Quinn frowns, a prickling sense of unease washing over him. <em>What the hell is going on?</em> <em>Why can't any of them look at him? Be in the same room as him? </em>he thinks as he ties off the stitch and stands, stripping off his bloody gloves as he retrieves the cooler and sets it on the bedside table while he grabs fresh gloves and starts another IV in Eliot's other arm. </p><p>"Hardison?" Eliot breathes, barely conscious, and the emotion in that one word makes Quinn suck in a shaky breath. Even with the pain and the drugs, there's an edge of devastation in Eliot's voice, like he's lost something precious to him and hasn't come close to making his peace with it. </p><p>"He was here," Quinn says, checking the first bag of blood before he hangs it from the tall lamp next to the bed. "He's doing geek stuff," he says, and Eliot blinks, teeth clamping down on his lower lip, anguish flickering over his face before he blinks and it vanishes. </p><p>"Okay," Eliot says, softly, and shifts, drawing his knee up towards his chest. He's on his left side, propped up with pillows under his chest and hips and the pressure on his bad shoulder is starting to hurt. Slow, strange nausea makes his gut churn, there but without any real urgency. It's the trauma and the drugs and the lingering effects of shock and he knows he's lucky he made it this long without puking because even the thought of it makes him want to weep. The exhaustion drags at him like an outgoing tide and he resists with what little energy he has left, bringing one shaking hand to scrub his face. <em>If they don't want me any more, I need a plan,</em> he thinks, ignoring the way it makes his chest burn, <em>time to find my own jobs again,</em> even though he knows realistically he's got weeks to go before he even makes it out of the bed. "Did they say anything?" he asks Quinn, voice rough, part of him wanting the blow to fall, to get it over with, a bigger part wanting to hide, to let himself pretend for just a little longer that the last good thing in his life hasn't imploded around him, just like everything else pure that he'd touched, like he's fucking Typhoid Mary, poisoning everyone around him, even if he can't see it until its way too late. He blinks and a tear trickles down his cheek, sliding into his hair. </p><p>"No," Quinn says, and his voice is husky. "What happened, El?" he asks. </p><p>"I think I fucked everything up," Eliot says, voice fading out as the exhaustion and the drugs pull him under again. </p><p>Part of Quinn wants to go and find Nate, shake a straight answer out of him, find out what the hell went down on the job, but Eliot is still bleeding and he needs to fix that first. There's two blood soaked dressings left on Eliot's back and Quinn peels the first away, sucking in a breath at the wound. It's a clean cut, made by a sharp blade, and it's defensive, though Quinn can't quite figure out why the worst of the damage is concentrated on his friend's back. It bugs him enough that he lets the suture kit drop to the mattress, rounding the bed in quick strides to check Eliot's arms again. There's a couple of shallow slices on his forearms and hands, but the majority of the cuts are on his upper arms and back. Quinn prefers guns to knives, but he's been around the block a bit and the damage just doesn't make sense to him. He pushes it aside for now and heads back to the other side of the bed, cleaning the wound before picking up the suture kit and carefully bringing the edges of the cut together. </p><p>Eliot flinches, moaning, as the needle slips through his skin. His right arm twitches, like he wants to ward Quinn off but doesn't have the strength or coordination. "Fuck," he breathes, the word filled with all the agony coursing through him and it's enough to make Quinn stand, injecting another careful dose of morphine into the IV. </p><p>It's a careful balancing act, keeping the dark-haired man drugged enough to manage his pain but not so far under it affects his breathing and Quinn watches anxiously as the drug takes effect, tipping Eliot back over into unconsciousness. </p><p>Quinn blows out a breath and gets to work, closing both cuts with careful, neat stitches. He's done all he can for now and he stands, shoving the chair back against the wall and hanging a new bag of blood. They both need this over, because Eliot has started to shiver again and Quinn adds another blanket to the bed, biting his lip, before he turns and heads for the door, intending to find Nate and get some answers. </p><p> </p>
