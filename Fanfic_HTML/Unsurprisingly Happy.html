      <p><span>"You are a </span><em> <span>very</span></em> <span> handsome cat. Yes, you are. Such a good cat."</span><br/><br/><span>Of  all the things that might have surprised Death in his own library a  year before, someone being overly affectionate with Lovejoy was near the  top of the list, just after destructive fire and the discovery of a new  language. He has learned to stop being surprised.</span><br/><br/><span>Lovejoy  is purring in the woman's arms when she comes around the shelf to his  desk, smiling wide enough that he could nearly believe she could purr,  herself. Her dark eyes are warm. They remind him of a young woman  lifetimes ago, long before Leck. When the lady queen had suggested he  take on this young woman as his assistant, Death had been unsure if it  was a good idea, but she has become invaluable. And Lovejoy likes her.  He is a very good judge of character. Also Death may have checked into  her family background.</span><br/><br/><span>"Should  we keep working on the histories today or did you want to switch?"  Lovejoy protests when he is set down, acting like a kitten again, trying  to push his way into her arms. She pets him patiently. Death likes that  she likes his cat.</span><br/><br/><span>"The histories would be most expedient. Gather your papers and we'll begin." </span><br/><br/><span>After  another afternoon of work, while she rushes down to the kitchens to see  if they have any tea and maybe the cookies Death likes best, he holds  Lovejoy himself and wonders how this young woman, of all the potential  literate and helpful people the lady queen could know, somehow found  herself working with him. He is overwhelmed, sometimes, how much she  reminds him of his sister. He wonders when he should tell her that.</span><br/><br/><span>She  returns with a tea tray laden with more than one type of cookie, and  the lady queen helping with another tray with the tea pot, cups, and  assorted paraphernalia. </span><br/><br/><span>"I  hope you don't mind me joining you, but Tilda was telling me about the  books you've been doing most recently and they sounded fascinating,"  explains Bitterblue as she sets the tray down. Death does not smile, but  he touches her hand.</span><br/><br/><span>"You  know you are always welcome, lady queen. For any reason you wish." She  pours tea for him first. Death enjoys a quiet break with the woman he  feels is as good as any granddaughter could be, if somehow his  granddaughter were the Queen, and his grandniece, and his cat, and he  is, unsurprisingly, </span> <em><span>happy</span></em><span>.</span><br/><br/><br/></p>
