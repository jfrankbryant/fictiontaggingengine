<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Jenny knows that she cannot run away, not from Aunt Agatha, not when she has everything that Jenny should have, everything that once belonged to Jenny and her father, things that she cannot leave behind. But walking, walking is a different story, because her aunt does not understand sacrifice and assumes that running is the only means of escape and that Jenny risks losing everything if she does.</p>
<p>So each day, Jenny moves a little further out of Agatha's reach until she finds a place of her own, one that Agatha thinks is too worthless to try and take away, a place where Jenny knows that all she needs to do is keep walking and one day she'll be free at last.</p>

  <p>The moment Matilda steps inside the village library, a wonderful feeling fills her and leaves her mind tingling.</p>
<p>All those books, all those wonderful stories and facts and knowledge... she was only glad there were large comfortable chairs, because for the first time in her life (all four years and three months), she felt a bit faint and didn't know where to start.</p>
<p><i>Something this glorious must be savoured slowly</i>, she decides, as she selects an adventurous looking volume bound in red, <i>there is plenty of time to read them all</i>.</p>

  <p><i>This was a mistake</i>, Miss Honey thinks, nervous that their first outing together as a family is just to the supermarket.</p>
<p>But it had been so long since her family had been anyone more than Aunt Agatha, and it's nostalgia that gave her the idea, a fond memory of going to the grocer with her father to buy ingredients to make dinner.</p>
<p>"Jenny, we can make beef stew and warm croissants, or maybe chicken penne, or pesto tomato pizza from our cookbooks," Matilda says excitedly as she points to shelves, and Miss Honey forgets what she was so afraid of in the first place.</p>
