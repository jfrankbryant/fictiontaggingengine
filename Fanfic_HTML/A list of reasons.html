<div id="chapters" class="userstuff">
    <h2 class="toc-heading">A list of reasons</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p><span>It  isn't the part where women prefer women that confuses Bitterblue. She  understands that, intimately. It's the confusion of liking </span> <em><span>everyone</span></em> <span> that makes her blush when Bren smiles and something in her stomach flutters in response.</span><br/><br/><span>Liking  Saf's sister is very, very wrong. It is wrong in ways she can list, and  she has done. The scrap of paper is now tucked inside a book of sums  which is in one of the drawers of her desk that only Bitterblue has keys  to, because the making of it made her feel so absurd she had to hide  the evidence. Somehow destroying it had felt worse, the sort of waste of  paper Bren would not approve of in the least, so it stays locked away.</span><br/><br/><em> <span>(</span><span>1. Bren is a woman. </span><br/><span>2. Bren is Saf's sister.</span><br/><span>3. Bren is already in a relationship with Tilda.</span><br/><span>4. Can't like Tilda too.</span><br/><span>5. Something is wrong with me.</span><span>)</span> </em><br/><br/><span>Bren  and Tilda both prefer women. Raffin, Bann, and Skye prefer men. That  all works out fine. No confusion there. Saf...Bitterblue had gotten the  idea that he liked both, but she'd come to think it must have been  because he needed so much to be wanted. It is startling to realise she  was so wrong. Unless </span> <em><span>she</span></em> <span> needs so much to be wanted. The line of thinking is absurd. Maybe it  was infectious, and by taking Saf for a lover, even once, she's caught  the line of thinking that </span> <em><span>anyone</span></em> <span> is potentially a match.</span><br/><br/><span>But  none of that matters, because Bren is Saf's sister, and thus  objectively not allowable under any circumstances. Not even if the way  she smirks is just like his, and the way she touches Tilda, a casual  hand on her lower back, makes Bitterblue shiver watching them. Even if  it would not be wrong because of her history with Saf, Bren is still  with Tilda and has been for a long time. She would not want to ruin that  for them for her own curiosity. The longer it goes on, the more she  worries it is curiosity about the both of them.</span><br/><br/><span>Perhaps she<em> </em></span><em> <span>is</span></em> <span> that needy after all.</span><br/><br/><br/><span>The  day Bren notices, Bitterblue wants nothing more than to curl up and die  of embarrassment. She can't, of course. It is not a Queenly way to die,  and they are in a meeting about the publication of school books, so she  can't even escape. The three of them are in her office, alone, with tea  and scones.</span><br/><br/><span>"You've  been watching us, lady queen." That smirk. Bitterblue wonders if  fainting is an option. "We noticed ages ago. You aren't very subtle."</span><br/><br/><span>Tilda  grins, and touches Bitterblue's shoulder. Her hand is warm, familiar.  "Don't make her nervous, Bren, it isn't kind. I happen to remember<em> </em></span><em> <span>someone</span></em> <span> was all in a panic when </span><em> <span>she</span></em> <span> first worked out she liked women and spent days crying about how  terrible she was." She grins again. "I somehow managed to disabuse of  her of that idea. Why not help the lady queen as well?"</span><br/><br/><span>Bren scowls. "My personal history is not--oh, you're determined to go through with this, then?" </span><br/><br/><span>Bitterblue  doesn't notice anything else Bren might say, because Tilda is kissing  her. She is soft, taller than Bitterblue but not by much, and her mouth  tastes very faintly of thyme. Warmth presses against her back, and  Bitterblue realises that Bren is standing behind her, leaning her weight  against her spine. </span><br/><br/><span>As she pulls back to breathe, leaning against Bren and looking at Tilda, Bitterblue bites her lip. "But--your brother. Saf. I--"</span><br/><br/><span>"I  don't really care what that idiot boy got up to, but details would put  me off. Would you rather I stop, lady queen?" Bren's hands have found  her hips and are inching upwards, very slowly.</span><br/><br/><span>"Er, no. Right. And this--but I still like men, too."</span><br/><br/><span>"And?  So does Tilda. Are you kissing men right now, or us?" Tilda grins and  kisses her again. With a sigh, Bitterblue allows it, surprised, but  perhaps a bit less worried. Needy or not, it feels safe to be held like  this. Bren makes an annoyed noise close by her ear, and takes  Bitterblue's chin in her hand, turning her face to kiss her. She kisses  like Saf, which is perhaps not the most productive line of thinking but  still true, sharp and like drowning. </span><br/><br/><span>"Lady  queen. I would like to suggest you come take a tour of the shop to see  the printing of these books yourself." Bren smiles, pressing another  swift kiss to her jaw. </span><br/><br/><span>"Yes. Yes, I think that will be a very good idea. Thank you. Would you escort me?"</span><br/><br/><span>Tilda is laughing again, and it makes Bitterblue smile, too. "Of course. We would be glad to, lady queen."</span></p>
