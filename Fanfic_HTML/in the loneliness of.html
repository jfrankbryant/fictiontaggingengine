    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Marco remembers little of the orphanage he grew up in. There was grey, grey, and more grey. It all seemed like a soft painting, disturbed only by the sharp cut of a precise suit worn by a man with features hard to remember. The man was grey, perhaps even moreso in the London atmosphere, but stood stark against the backdrop of almost everything else. As if he knew he didn’t belong. As if he made it exactly like that.</p><p>Marco was watching from the window when the grey man arrived. It was like seeing a dream without the blur and cotton in his mouth and ears. The grey man took one step in front of the other, sure and confident, cutting into the dullness. But when he went up to Mother, Marco saw a tired set of shoulders and a weary gaze that seemed to hold more than what let on. He was curious, and almost approached, but one of his brothers called for him to play, so he followed.</p><p>Later, Marco is called into the Green Room with two of his other siblings, and he for some reason, passes a test with unmentioned criteria. He leaves the orphanage with the Grey Man, and moves into a bleak little house with no one inside. People came and went for a while, taking measurements, bringing in bits and bobs of anything practical but devoid of personality. After a week, he begins his lessons.</p><p>He learns things. He learns that the Grey Man's name is Alexander—even if his mentor says that a name is not really necessary, it is what it is. Marco watches Alexander do things he thought were only pressed and marked in books and impossible tales. He is given inkwells, pens, and papers. Marco enjoys it, learning that he could do what others couldn’t. (Though, he is reminded that anyone could do it with much study.)</p><p>It is more preferable than the orphanage, he finds, after a few weeks of solitude and quiet. (There is no fighting over Sunday Pudding, nor is there a loud awkward jeering when it comes to bath time.)</p><p>He called it magic, when he was younger, fascinated by Arthurian legends and Merlin and Shakespeare. Alexander corrected it soon after, saying that what they could do is nothing but a portion of the universe that they can manipulate. Because people only see what they want to believe, and they believe that what they do is false. Marco, not quite understanding, nodded. From then on, he called it manipulation. It didn’t sound as inspiring as <em>magic</em> did, but it was better than something most believed was an illusion.</p><p>Before, when Alexander was around longer, teaching him spells and runes and symbols, Marco would hold up his finished work to him. Marco’s fingers were a bit numb from perfecting the spells, and ink stained his skin, shirts, and got under his nails. He never got what normal children received as a reward, but he was content with the small smile that Alexander gave him, if he was ever satisfied.</p><p>Growing older, the smiles became rarer until they never came at all. Marco recalls the last one right before the Bowens' old ring scarred his hand.</p><p>He had asked Alexander if he ever had any other students, out of some childish wonder or curiosity. Alexander looked at him in muted surprise. It was not the way other adults looked surprised, like when Marco told the nice maid who brought him cookies for snacks that she was pretty, and she laughed and blushed and almost knocked over the milk. It was not a small gasp hidden under a hand, eyes wide and curious, and interest curling into their mouth. Alexander’s eyebrows were raised for a fraction, his eyes widening just a bit. His mouth becomes smaller and his head tilts slightly to the side. It lasted for a moment before his lips formed a rueful smile, and he nodded.</p><p>“Today we will learn about binding,” Alexander said next, and pain removed any other question about the others. Marco never forgot the lonely, pained smile his mentor wore. A short bout of weakness that never showed itself again even in their sparse meetings of lessons.</p><p>Marco kept learning and writing and working. The pressure to make Alexander smile was great, and seeing Alexander himself was already sparse.</p><p>Years would pass and his lessons ended on a brief note, devoid of any emotional partings. Standing in his new flat, there was a hollowness in his chest that he couldn't fathom. His old home was bleak and grey, same as the new one. It reminded him of his mentor. His forest of books remained, and so did the style of his clothing. Perhaps it was the lack of presence that he wasn't used to.</p><p>Even if Alexander seemed like an entity separate from time, his presence was always quiet but <em>there</em>. It wasn’t so comforting as it was calming, and him just being there was like being tied to the reality of normalcy. It was easier to do his work that way, knowing that his pseudo-father was there, but his absence took an even greater toll than Marco thought. He pushed himself to succeed for his mentor. His only family.</p><p>Now that Alexander was out of the equation though, and Marco was free. So he chose not to dwell on the twinge of sadness in his chest and explored the city. He kept practicing his lessons, on himself, on Isobel, on Chandresh. He asked for work and more work and let himself think that he loved Isobel, long enough until he felt nothing in his chest and allowed himself to breathe.</p><p>And then came Celia, and he felt it.</p><p><em>(“Alexander, of all the things you could have warned me, you could have warned me of </em>this<em>.")</em></p>
