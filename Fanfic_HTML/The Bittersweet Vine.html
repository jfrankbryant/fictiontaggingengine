      <p>Everything aches like you’ve run a marathon, and maybe in a way you have. This time when Shadow brings you tea or broth--you’re down to broth--it isn’t for fun or bonding.</p><p>“I feel pummeled,” you tell him.</p><p>“I know. Well...you were.”</p><p>“I don’t understand,” you say, although at certain points you do. This is the price that grief is extracting, one terrible moment at a time.</p><p>“There’s something maybe you know about,” Shadow says, and you can tell he’s trying to be gentle. “It’s called Stockholm syndrome and…”</p><p>“Shadow, maybe if I had--”</p><p>“No. Stop. Listen.”</p><p>But you’re floating away, not able to process words to do with all of that, not now.</p><p>You don’t listen. And Shadow lets go.</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>Later you are alone. Sometimes it is necessary.</p><p>You stand in front of the tree, dead center in the middle of your backyard. You have such things, because they have been given to you; they serve a purpose.</p><p>You stand there now, under the oak, and you call to your Father.</p><p>“Very funny,” you say, hoarse and disoriented. “Very funny. I know you think this is a big joke. Something about only in the mirror, right? Never where anyone else can--.”</p><p>And you stop yourself. Because you know that isn’t exactly fair. You <em>do</em> have your Father and--.</p><p>And so you stop yourself, but the anger boils low in your gut. You stumble back inside. Angry.</p><p>You haven’t solved anything.</p><p>You listen to the wind and it has never lied to you, not once, but it doesn’t have anything to say.</p><p>And so there is rage.</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>Shadow is still worried, you can feel it in everything that he does, from the way his footfalls echo on the floor, on upward. <em>Any bright ideas?</em> he’s saying to you.</p><p>“I don’t know,” you say, realizing belatedly that he never asked the question out loud.</p><p>He’s a little shaky, but he rolls with it. Of course you both know what he’s asking and why.</p><p>There’s a period of silence. Then...</p><p>“Did--” Shadow blinks hard, nervous, upset, whatever. He’s looking at you but it’s like seeing him through a film, or a telescope lense turned the wrong way round. Soon he’ll be Charlie Brown teacher noise. “Winchester.”</p><p>You try to focus on him. This time, you manage.</p><p>“Did Sam believe in you?” he asks. “I mean, <em>believe in you</em>?”</p><p>And you think of mysteriously-appearing Twinkies and just-in-the-knick-of-time quarters and conspicuous recyclables, and the demands.</p><p>The demands were a form of belief too, in their weird way.</p><p>“Yes,” you whisper.</p><p>What do you do now?</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>You’re shakier than you realized you were and you let Shadow take you outside. To the tree.</p><p>“Stay here,” you say, nervous and worried.</p><p>And he will, this time, now that you’ve asked, even though the tree, the birds, they’re, well… Not exactly yours but....</p><p>He wraps you in a blanket and sits beside you. Nothing fancy. But you take what you can, what you need to, from the earth.</p><p>There are people who want you here, in Midgard. There are people who believe in you, in Midgard.</p><p>It takes you a little bit, just sitting there together, but you do remember:</p><p>Shadow believes in you.</p><p>You take his hand. “Hey,” you whisper. “I know you do too. I know you do.”</p><p>He squeezes your hand. “Thank you,” is all he says. Then he squeezes it again.</p><p>There are people who believe in you in Midgard. On earth.</p><p>You take a deep breath and remember how to let that sink in.</p>
