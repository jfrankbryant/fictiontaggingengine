that remarkable book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
that's all
that's it that's the fic
that's literally all it is
the author cried while writing this my god i'm such a sap
the children of wakanda all adore bucky barnes

the drift is not inherently romantic and i will die on this hill
the ending is tragic and I consider the radio series end to be canon

the tree is not asleep but it is meditating and would prefer if they would stop chattering
then back to lovers again
there are no happy endings
there were supposed to be
there's a difference
there's also a small bonus scene in the end notes with the prince in it
there's random splattering of song lyrics
these tags make the fic seem really dark but it's not i promise
these two are honestly the only pairing that matters
they actually talk
they are canon
they cant kill their soulmates
they react differently because the circumstances are very different from canon
theyre all around 17
thg
things happen to him A LOT
this is about the book not the movie
