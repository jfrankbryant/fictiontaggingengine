Sophie and Nate’s daughter is going to grow up the most protected little girl in the universe. Only Olivia Sterling is perhaps similarly protected, but Jemma is the one who’ll have Eliot and Alec and Parker as her godparents and by virtue of their and her parents’ combined skills she will approach majority not only safe and secure but also capable of protecting herself and others as well as self-sufficient.  If the five of them do their jobs right she will never be forced to actually use what she knows for anything but fun. * Parker doesn’t want kids. She doesn’t want the change to her body, she doesn’t want to be slowed down, and no matter how much Alec and Eliot have come to love her, she doesn’t want to risk passing on the weirdness that’s in her head to a kid. That’s the part she never tells Alec about. Luckily, since he is firm on her body being her own, he never fishes for this particular explanation.  So Parker doesn’t have kids. What she does have, a few years into excelling as her own team’s mastermind, is a considerable number of adolescents that have her number. She is careful not to repeat Archie’s mistake – every kid that calls her up as a mentor is treated as equally important. \\xa0 . ',\n",

       "  'story_text': 'A clatter of pots and pans awoke Sophie in the middle of the night - a shame, she thought, she’d been having a nice dream. ‘Mae bys Meri-Ann wedi brifo,’ Howl’s hoarse voice sang out of the racket, slurring each word as it did so. ‘Shhh!’ She heard a muffled Calcifer say to the wizard. ‘You’ll wake Sophie you fool!’ With mention of her name she thought it an apt time to make an entrance - it was either that or stay in bed and risk Howl accidentally knocking a bucket of water on Calcifer (again). Sluggishly, she pulled herself up and out of bed, grabbing her dressing gown as she stomped out of the bedroom. ‘It’s too late now, I’m awake.’ She huffed as she plodded up to her husband, who was lying, near unconscious, on the floor, still singing in Welsh. It was a good job Michael was such a heavy sleeper, she thought, or no doubt he’d be woken too. ‘Cariad!’ Howl spluttered and stretched his arms out. She pouted and walked over to the sink. ‘I’m sorry Sophie, I did warn him not to make so much noise.’ Calcifer cowered in the fireplace - he almost worried that Sophie would take out more anger on him than the noise-maker himself. ‘Don’t you apologise - he’s the one who can’t control his bloody drink. Every time he goes to a rugby reunion it’s always the same!’ She said while filling up a glass of water. With a small smirk, she wandered back over to her horizontal husband, who looked almost ready to doze off on the spot, and emptied the glass contents on his face. ‘Ha!’ Calcifer let out a laugh. ‘What the-?’ Howl shot up. ‘What was that for?’ He slurred at Sophie, who was evidently pleased with herself. ‘You can’t sleep on the floor Howl. And you’re too heavy for me to pick you up, so I thought this would do the trick.’ Howl wobbled from side to side, which prompted Sophie to steady him with her own body. ‘God, Howl, you stink. What on earth do they drink in Wales?’ She sniffed her husband, who smelled remarkably like the stuff she cleaned the toilet with. ‘I love you.’ He ignored her question, nestling his head into her shoulder and nearly toppling them both. ‘Ugh!’ She propped him up again, using all of her strength this time - he was definitely heavier than the last time she’d done this. ‘Let’s get you to bed you smelly wizard.’ Howl smirked. ‘In the spare bedroom, obviously. I can’t sleep next to you when you reek this badly.’ Sophie explained, causing Howl’s smirk to turn into a grimace. With Howl slouched over her like a sack of potatoes, she hobbled upstairs. ‘Night Calcifer.’ She whispered, as the fire demon was already dozing in the fireplace once again. He let out a little sigh in an acknowledgement. Once in the spare room, Sophie worked to remove the wizard’s dirty boots, which were covered in mud from yet another Welsh downpour. It was always raining there. With boots off she shoved Howl into bed, placing a blanket over him as he refused to get under the covers. ‘Goodnight, Howl.’ She huffed and turned to leave, only a hand grabbed hers. ‘Sophie...’ he trailed off, half asleep. ‘I’m sorry I got so drunk... I didn’t mean to... it was Aled and the...vodka....’ he squeezed her hand. ‘Well, you’re a grown man, you’re responsible for your own drunkenness - vodka or not!’ She wasn’t quite sure what ‘vodka’ was, or if she was saying it in the right context. ‘I love you... so much... cariad...’, he said before falling asleep. As annoyed as Sophie was over his drunken entrance, she couldn’t help but soften at this. Even in this state he was still thinking about how much he loved her. She smiled. ‘Maybe sleeping in the same bed won’t be too bad,’ she whispered to herself before crawling in next to him. ',\n",

You send Parker to the store, you end up with chewing gum, three of the wrong flavor of Rockstar, a block of store-brand Velveeta, and a pack of matches from a club that went out of business ten years ago.  Not that there's anything wrong with Velveeta, but Rockstar has good flavors and bad flavors, c'mon, people.  So staples get delivered, generic footloops next to five different kinds of flours (it says all purpose on the bag, right there: All. Purpose. All-purpose.) and yet Parker sits cross legged on the back of the sofa watching game shows in Japanese while eating chips from a bag with Arabic letters at night, and in the morning, when she and he are still curled together under the floral duvet that appeared one day (he doesn't know who found it, except he's pretty sure he didn't. Not entirely sure, just pretty sure.), he can hear Eliot pulling open the fridge door in the near silence of the apartment to pop in whatever he bought at dawn at the Farmer's Market on Third and Waterfront. He can't hear him, but he can feel him, and he lifts one edge of the duvet in an invitation that Eliot doesn't (shouldn't) need buts waits for anyway every damn time. Parker grumbles at the draft, but Alec waits while Eliot sheds his clothes and slides in. Then she really writhes, his chilled skin against her sleep warm one, but having Parker wiggle against him isn't so bad, not bad at all, and eventually, once Eliot can't stand being still any more, he'll snake one hand across her to him and tangle their fingers together. Then later, Eliot'll make breakfast and grumble about the grocery list, and how he has basil but not the right basil and Parker will sit, barefoot and crosslegged on the counter and light matches one after another until Eliot smacks her with a spatula, and that turns into a wrestling match until Alec threatens to use the sink sprayer on them both, and yet nothing burns and they sit down to eggs with the wrong basil and the right cheese and the three of them. Precisely, exactly right. \",\n",

       "  'story_text': \"When her brothers were alive, Seven wasn’t alone.\\xa0 Of course, she was isolated in the fact that she wasn’t like the others. That was something she was told nearly every day growing up. “I’m afraid there’s nothing special about you, Number Seven,” her father would say. “You can’t play with the others.” Despite that unfortunate fact, she was never alone. She had Five and Six. The three of them were inseparable, no matter how much their father told them that Vanya was to be left alone. She was given her own schedule and curriculum. She was kept busy.\\xa0 Her two brothers did their best to include her when they could. It wasn't anything amazing, however. During their short breaks after lunch, the three of them would curl up in the library. They didn’t have to worry about anyone bothering them. (Except maybe Klaus, who seemed to be attached at the hip with Ben.) Most of the time they would read, but sometimes they held a mini-concert for Vanya, or a lecture with Five, or an impromptu therapy session with Ben. It started with Vanya going there alone, as she always did. The library was a quiet sanctuary for her. She could read or play or dream of having powers, and nobody would judge her. It was Ben who had joined her at first. He hadn’t meant to, he had said, and apologized profusely for ruining her peace. The apology was what shocked her. None of the others ever apologized to her. She let him stay that day, and the next, and the next, and soon it was tradition. They would sit and read, and sometimes they would talk. Their own secret book club. That changed when Five disappeared.\\xa0 Five came next. He wanted somewhere to be away from the rest of their siblings, just like Vanya and Ben. Why exactly, Vanya was never sure. She supposed it had to do with the fact that she and Ben were below him. He was Number Five, so that meant he was more important than the quiet Number Six and the ordinary Number Seven. They didn’t pose a threat. Five wasn’t as mean as he seemed, Vanya concluded. He actually listened to her opinions and acknowledged her presence. And Ben, while he was about as quiet as her, was kind. The three of them quickly became thick as thieves.\\xa0 Vanya stayed up every night, waiting for him to come home. She made him a peanut butter and marshmallow sandwich, set out a glass of milk, and kept some lights on. She was terrified that he would home and think that they all left. For the first couple of nights, everyone stayed up with her. Luther was the first to leave, followed by Allison. Diego left a week later, mumbling about how Five was lucky to have escaped. Soon, it was only Vanya, Ben, and Klaus. But even they gave up after a while.\\xa0 Vanya grew a little more distant. She had just lost her best friend and brother. The ache in her heart never subsided, and Reginald upped her dosage. Even though she had Ben, she still felt lonely. He didn’t spend as much time as her, instead passing the days with Klaus. The years passed, and Five never returned.\\xa0 When Ben died, Vanya felt the space between herself and her family grow even bigger. “1 2 3 4 . . 7″. Without Ben and Five, she didn’t have anything keeping her tied to the Academy. She wasn’t special; she didn’t have powers. What use was she? Klaus was the only one she related to anymore, but she distanced herself from even him. He reminded her too much about Ben, and the thought of him brought tears to her eyes. Her medication increased. The moment they turned eighteen, Vanya left the Academy. She lived in motels with the cash her father had given her, working odd jobs until she could afford to live in an apartment. The years passed, and her brothers and sister stopped checking up with her. And, honestly, Vanya didn’t care anymore. They hadn’t included her for years, so what place did they have in her life? At least, that’s what she told herself as she stayed awake at night.\\xa0 She eventually joined an orchestra, but she still found it impossible to connect to anyone. She was awkward, and quiet, and she felt panicked whenever she had to talk to people. Her medication was increased. She desperately wanted to blame her father or her siblings for this. It had to be their fault she was so messed up. That she couldn’t make any friends.\\xa0 Then, she saw a typewriter in the window of a shop. \",\n",

       "  'story_text': '‘Owwwww!’ Howl stomped in through the front door, freshly bruised from a reunion rugby game with his university pals. ‘Sophie?’ He called out, wondering why she wasn’t waiting by the door to nurse him immediately after the game. He called out again to no avail. ‘She’s gone out,’ grumbled Calcifer from the fireplace, noisily awoken from his afternoon slumber by Howl’s whining.  ‘Where in all of Ingary could she possibly have gone? She knows I need to be nursed after my rugby games!’ Howl slumped down on the sofa, letting out a painful groan as he did so. Calcifer rolled his eyes. Why would anyone want to play such a vicious sport, he thought, especially if it prompted so much whining?  ‘She didn’t say where she was going. Probably to visit Martha or Lettie, or maybe Fanny. So many possibilities.’ Calcifer feigned concern. All he was concerned about at this moment was sleep. ‘I could. But I don’t want to.’ ‘And they call me heartless!’ Howl was getting impatient now - not one person seemed to care how hurt he was. ‘Michael?’ He shouted. ‘Gone too I’m afraid - said something about surprising Martha.’ ‘What’s the point in living with so many people if they’re never in!’ Howl wailed, and Calcifer sensed he was only one more tantrum away from oozing green slime. Luckily, the Kingsbury door opened at that moment and Sophie walked in before any slime could be oozed. ‘Finally!’ Howl cried out, exaggerating his pain in another loud grunt, ‘I am terribly injured. Sophie I really think I might die.’ ‘Oh calm down Howl it’s just a few bruises. What’s more concerning to me is your smell!’ She threw her basket down on the kitchen counter, and began unloading various produce from it, barely glancing at the battered wizard. ‘You do smell horrible.’ Calcifer agreed. ‘So now I’m injured and insulted. The company in this house is dreadful!’ Howl shot a snickering Calcifer an angry look.  ‘I think I’ll go find some peace and quiet for my nap elsewhere. Maybe Lettie and Ben’s, they have a nice big fireplace.’  Calcifer declared and promptly disappeared. ‘Sooooophie!’ Howl whined, this time clutching at his ribs in apparent agony. ‘Sophie seriously I feel terrible! You really need to look after me!’  Sophie, who was trying to ignore her wailing husband by busying herself with food preparation, turned to face the whiny wizard. ‘What exactly is wrong, Howl?’ ‘It was Ewan, he tackled me from behind when I thought I was in the clear - I think he broke a rib or something! And he got my hair all muddy!’  Sophie couldn’t tell if Howl was more upset about his injury or his hair, though she had a strong idea. ‘Ugh, let’s see then!’ If Howl was really set on having her dote on him, he wouldn’t mind going hungry for a bit. Sitting beside Howl she rolled up his shirt slightly to get a better look at what was giving him grief. He yelped in pain. Sophie rolled her eyes. ‘Stop being so dramatic,’ she sighed. ‘Dramatic! DRAMATIC! I’ll have you know I could die, I think that deserves a little drama!’ He sank into the sofa, being sure to let out another groan as he did so. ‘I could have told you that.’ Howl snarled. ‘Well if you’re so capable of diagnosing yourself I’ll get back to chopping those carrots,’ she made to get up but Howl grabbed her hand. ‘No! I’m sorry, cariad. I’m just in so much pain.’ ‘I’ll never understand why you love that wretched sport so much - you always seem to come back bruised and battered! Even fighting the Witch of the Waste didn’t leave you in this bad of a state!’ Despite her joking tone, Howl sensed genuine concern in his wife’s voice. He knew she hated seeing him hurt, even if he was milking it. ‘It’s perfectly safe, cariad,’ he comforted her. ‘I’m just a bit out of practice.’ ‘I hope that doesn’t mean you’re going to be practicing more often!’ She said, annoyed. ‘Anyway let’s get back to this damned rib.’  She went to the sink in order to wet a cloth, then placed it on Howl’s injured spot. ‘That helps,’ he breathed a sigh of relief. When the cloth had seemingly soothed all it could, Sophie decided that more magical means would provide a quicker cure. Softly, she touched the swollen area and said, ‘right then rib, you’ve taken a bit of a blow but now it’s time for you to stop giving Howl so much grief.’ The spell seemed to work, as the swelling slowly went down and the redness disappeared. ‘Ah!’ Howl sighed, pain free at last. ‘You really should consider a career in nursing.’ ‘I’m fine with the flower shop thank you very much! Now will you promise to stop getting yourself so hurt at these rugby matches! You’re too old to be getting beaten up all the time.’ Sophie said sternly. ‘Too old! You soothe one injury only to give me another! You truly are an evil woman.’ ‘And you’re an evil, heartless man making me worry so much about you!’ Sophie’s concern for her husband now brimmed at the surface, only subsiding when he placed a hand on her cheek. ‘How about I just watch from the sidelines next time?’ He smiled, which seemed to melt all Sophie’s troubles away. ‘Well, that’s a start. I better get back to dinner.’ She made to get up, but Howl had other plans. ‘The carrots can wait,’ he smirked as he placed his lips on hers, any semblance of pain gone. ',\n",

       "  'story_text': '“There’s a lot of magic around here, certainly,” Howl said, gesturing with one hand and wrapping his other arm around Sophie’s waist, as if he needed to distract everyone else to do it. Sophie rolled her eyes and leaned into him, smiling for a moment before she returned her attention to the woods. “It looks like something was crashing about over there,” she said, pointing towards a clump of slightly squashed bushes. “Shall we look?” They’d gone less than a hundred feet when Howl frowned and rubbed at his head. “Calcifer, what are you doing back there?” he demanded, letting go of Sophie to twist around and glare at him. “Moving the castle someplace?” “I’m not doing anything,” Calcifer protested. “I thought you were.” “I most certainly am not. Sophie?” “Someone’s doing something big, moving something around –” The strange sea-sick feeling at the back of her head stopped rather abruptly. “Thank you, Sophie,” Howl said, kissing her hand with most of his usual elegance. She reclaimed her fingers somewhat reluctantly, still concerned with what exactly had just happened. “Er.” Calcifer drifted as close to their heads as he safely could, crackling anxiously. “There’s a bit of a problem.” “What do you mean?” Sophie asked. “The doorway isn’t where we left it.” “Yes. Someone moved it.” “It feels like the entire clearing isn’t there anymore,” Calcifer said. There may have been some swearing at this point. It was at this point that Sophie realized that someone else had appeared: a young woman – no, not exactly young, around forty; Sophie had been her proper age for nearly six months, but she still sometimes got a bit vague about relative ages – with mostly-black hair, sturdy russet trousers, and a distinctly queasy expression. “Good heavens,” she gasped, bracing herself against a tree. “It’s never done that before.” She glanced at them, eyes widening when she saw Calcifer. “Who are you?” “Er.” Sophie paused. “I’m Sophie Hatter, and this is my, um, fiancé, the Wizard Howl –” “Argelfraster!” There was another, different sense of strong magic going past, and then a strong smell of lemon as soap and water exploded all over Howl, who squawked incoherently. The woman frowned. “What on earth are you doing?” Sophie demanded. “I assure you, he was perfectly clean.” “It wasn’t supposed to do that,” the woman protested. “Well, what was it supposed to do, irritate me to death?” Howl demanded, wringing out his sleeves. “Melt him.” “Hold on. If you’re a wizard, where’s your staff?” “I don’t have one. They just get in the way.” “For goodness’ – how are you a wizard if you don’t have a staff?” “Since when do we have to have a staff?” The woman looked at him as if he were very stupid indeed. “Every wizard I have ever met, in the Society or not, has had a staff. How do you do your magic without one?” “The same way every other wizard, sorcerer, or magician in the –” “Those are three entirely different things,” she protested. “If it weren’t for the forest, I’d think you weren’t really magic at all.” Sophie was beginning to get a rather nasty feeling. “Calcifer,” she asked again, “where exactly have you brought us?” Calcifer’s flames flickered sheepishly. “Er. I think it may be another world.” Everyone blinked at this. “Perhaps we had better start again,” the woman said at last. “I’m Cimorene. Sophie, Howl, and –” “That’s Calcifer,” Sophie explained. “He’s a fire demon – oh, don’t worry, he’s quite harmless. Mostly.” “Care to explain why you melt wizards on sight?” Howl huffed, still wringing out his hair. “Ah. Well. We’ve been at war with them for some time, you see, and they’ve caused us… quite a bit of trouble.” Cimorene shut her eyes for a moment. “Anyway, I’m very pleased to meet you, and I’m sorry about the melting. And, for reference, your, er, fire demon has landed you in the Enchanted Forest.” “What fool went and enchanted an entire forest?” Howl muttered, fiddling with his shirt. “Nobody did. It just – grows this way. It’s a bit complicated. And usually it doesn’t let people in, particularly not powerfully magical people – it seems quite upset about finding you here.” “It moved our door,” Calcifer grumbled. “If that was it.” “Who’s Mendanbar?” Sophie asked, pulling Howl to his feet. Cimorene smiled. “My husband. He’s also the king of the forest, which is why –” “King? Ah –” Sophie fumbled quickly for her skirts, wishing she’d been a bit more polite. Cimorene flapped a hand at her impatiently. “Oh, don’t waste time with any of that nonsense. Yes, technically I’m the queen, but nobody makes much of a fuss about it here.” “Oh. Well then.” Sophie straightened up and followed Cimorene, feeling a bit foolish and more than a bit unsettled. Howl and Calcifer followed. “Why exactly did you end up here, anyway?” Cimorene asked conversationally as they walked. “We had a bit of an accident with a rather vicious flying pig,” Howl said before Sophie could answer. Cimorene blinked. “What sort of accident?” “We got one, for a start,” Howl grumped. “And then it got loose,” Calcifer supplied. “And went out the enchanted door – I’m in charge of the door. I sent it the first place I could think of that it wouldn’t cause any riots, and then we had to chase it.” “I see. Well, I don’t think it will cause too much trouble around here.” “Interesting is the least of it. And if that thing isn’t trying to bite you, then I think you’ll fit in beautifully while you’re here.” Sophie smiled back, finding, to her surprise, that she wanted to know more about this odd queen and her forest.

       "  'story_text': \"Calcifer floated in a state of weightlessness.  It was a sensation not at all unfamiliar.  In fact, he'd spent most of his existence in this state.  Only briefly had he been confined to Ingary's gravity well while bound to the wizard Howl Pendragon...well, Howl Jenkins actually, but that was irrelevant as far as Calcifer was concerned.  Flying up from its surface had been far more difficult than falling to it. The sights around him were new, for he had not spent much time near Ingary, even before he'd fallen.  The broad curve defining Ingary lay below him, the blue haze of its atmosphere marking the boundary between that world and the black of space.  Above that hung the planet's rings.  They flickered now and then with a pearly incandescence as they responded to the stellar winds. Beyond that, off to his right, the red blobby star the Ingarians called Krakanen pulsed in the distance, its own vast atmosphere ebbing and flowing around the four other star systems that orbited it.  To Calcifer's right shone Ingary's sun Lirosh, furthest from Krakanen, but still within its influence.  That was his destination. An hour later, Calcifer found himself fighting his way up the powerful wind pouring off of Lirosh.  He was barely within the star's corona.  It was already quite hot, even for a fire demon.  He could feel the radiation hammering at him and he was beginning to wonder if there'd be anything of him left by the time he reached the upper chromosphere.  Most of his kind who'd tried this had been far stronger than he and had legitimately survived the un-birthing. Without warning, a flare leaped off the photosphere, reaching out toward Calcifer with astonishing speed.  It wrapped around him and pulled him inward.  He did not struggle.  Rather, he relaxed.  If death was to take him, then so be it, for he knew that by all rights, he should have died many years ago. His downward motion stopped after a while.  He was surrounded by the seething lower atmosphere of the star.  He could see nothing but bright light and he was glad his kind didn't see with eyes the way Ingarians and humans did. Abruptly, a voice boomed at him from within the star.  “Who are you and what do you want?!” If Calcifer could swallow, he would have done so.  Instead, he summoned his courage, then answered.  “I am Calcifer, recently of Ingary.  I have come as one who has survived the un-birthing.” “Have you, now?  You are not as strong as the others.  What makes you think you are worthy to be joined to me as my avatar?” Calcifer didn't have an answer.  Instead, he could feel himself being scrutinized from the inside out.  The energy being that powered Lirosh seemed to be quite thorough. “You have been joined to another once before,” said the voice with a note of curiosity.  “To...a human of Earth.” “It is as you say.”  Lying to a sun was always a bad idea, especially when one wished to become its avatar.  “I carried his heart for several of Ingary's orbital periods they call years.” There was silence for a few moments. “Your arrival is fortuitous, as is your familiarity with the organic inhabitants of Ingary.  I have need of one such as yourself.  I will therefore join with you as my avatar.  You will be my eyes in the places my light does not go.  You will see the interiors of their buildings.  You will be watchful on the planet's periodic dark side.  You will go where I send you throughout the greater Krakanen system.  Most of all, you will learn what you can about the state of affairs in the Sol system, as it has been some time since any of us has heard much from there.  In return, I will refrain from subsuming your identity beneath my own as is customary. “Now come.  I will bolster your strength.  While I do this, we have much to discuss.” ***** Howl's castle was in a state of chaos.  It often was these days.  Howl had a ferocious backlog of spells to deliver and precious little time in which to perform them.  Sophie was furiously pouring over several books on genetics Howl had smuggled back from Earth.  It had consumed her every waking moment, and even some of her dreams.  Consequently, she'd had to turn over every aspect of the flower shop to Markl and Lettie. Markl had to abandon many of his duties as Howl's apprentice to help Lettie.  Lettie still wound up doing more than half the work.  The strain killed their relationship, for which Sophie might have been thankful had she been paying attention to anything other than amino acids, nucleotides, peptide chains, catalases and the like. Calcifer hurtled down the chimney and into the cacophony, just in time to hear Sophie's screeching plea for silence.  She was, apparently, in a mood. Howl glanced up.  “Calcifer!  I was wondering where'd you gone.  What kept you?” Calcifer was about to speak when he noticed Howl's raised eyebrow.  That always meant something, especially when he did it like that. “Calcifer!” said Howl.  “You did it...didn't you?” “Yes,” replied Calcifer.  “But we have some problems.” “Would you two...” began Sophie irritably.  Her tone changed when she noticed Calcifer.  “Calcifer!” she said cheerily.  “I've missed you!  Did you do it?  Oh...of course you did.  Now, would you two please quiet down so I can study?  This is a matter of life and death!” “So is this, I'm afraid,” said Calcifer. “What is?” said Howl. “Krakanen is dying,” said Calcifer. “Well, yes,” said Howl, “I knew that.” “Of course you did,” said Sophie sarcastically. Howl looked at his fiancee.  “Really, dear, I did.  Earth's astronomers have known for quite some time.  We have two names for that star...Betelgeuse and Alpha-Orionis.  It's what we call a red supergiant and we estimate it should go supernova in about a million years.” “Wait,” said Howl, “You're saying Krakanen is going to explode in just two centuries?” “That's correct.” “I don't understand.” “The Witch of the Waste's fire demon was Krakanen's avatar.  When we killed it, we killed the energy being that powers the star.  It's on its death bed, as it were.” A pregnant silence ensued.  Markl poked his head into the room. “What's with all the silence?” he asked.  “Oh, hello, Calcifer.”  He nodded to the fire demon. “Markl,” said Sophie gravely, “it looks like you, me, my sisters and Howl will all live to see the second sun explode.” “Honey,” said Howl, “I love you very much, but I regret to say I won't live past a hundred.” Howl's eyebrows went up. “What was all that?” said Markl. Markl looked at him blankly.  “What's DNA?” Markl nodded. “What most people don't know is that the bride was Ingarian and the groom was human.  She's trying to prevent that.  If it happens again, there are people in your own government who will want to attack Earth.  So, yes, if the procedure doesn't work, Sophie's and my wedding could trigger an interstellar war.” Markl blinked. \",\n",

       "  'story_text': 'He sets down his bottle with the other empties and goes for the next one. There\\'s a loud knock on the door. Haymitch ignores it. It comes again, more insistent. \"Sir,\" a terse voice calls, \"President Coin requests your presence.\" Without turning, Haymitch takes one of the empty bottles and hurls it at the door. The shattering crash is very satisfying, and the sound of startled boots jumping a half-step back even more so. But the knock comes again, hesitant at first, then stronger. \"Sir, it\\'s about the Capitol prisoners. Pardons, so forth.\" Haymitch sets down the bottle and curses the air blue between his bed and the door. But he comes. \\xa0 The walk through the mansion is long, and Haymitch\\'s legs are wobbly. President Coin greets him with barely-concealed dislike, and he smiles to himself to see her anticipating an argument. Good. He\\'d hate to disappoint. She and the other higher-ups are gathered around a long table in the new war room, and Haymitch takes his seat without any particular grace or style. They are, as promised, discussing the Capitol prisoners, mostly people that were already down there when the rebels took over. Haymitch doesn\\'t give a rat\\'s ass. He drifts. \"Effie?\" Plutarch is saying, clearly startled. \"She\\'s alive?\" Haymitch finds himself on his feet without really thinking about getting up. \"I want to see her.\" President Coin gives him one of those tight, long-suffering looks of hers. \"As an escort from the Games, she\\'s the wrong kind of symbol to--\" Plutarch is saying something else, but, it doesn\\'t matter. Because, again, Haymitch finds himself doing something he hadn\\'t really decided to do. Yelling. He doesn\\'t know exactly what he\\'s saying, because his brain has clearly decided to detach from the rest of his body, but Haymitch knows his job. His job is to protect people who don\\'t have a goddamn clue how to do it for themselves. He can go to his grave a stumbling, slurring, worthless old man, and not give a damn, as long as he does his job, right here and now. Eventually Plutarch calms him down enough to put logical arguments on the table. Pardons, a show of good faith. Haymitch is sober enough by now to put forward \"recognizable symbol of reform\" and see the idea take place in Coin\\'s head.  She lets him go down to the cells. Haymitch chalks up another victory for team pain-in-the-ass. \\xa0 The cell door is rusty. Inside is dimly lit. The woman huddled in on herself in the corner is unrecognizable for a moment. Drab hair, dirty skin, no clothes to speak of. The automatic flinch away from the door certainly belongs to a stranger. But she sees him. Her eyes widen, then narrow. Her jaw ticks. Her head lifts, her shoulders straighten. Haymitch stumbles across the cell, drops down beside her, and pulls her roughly against him. She\\'s shaking uncontrollably, her whole body rigid. He holds her until the shaking stops. ',\n",

       "  'story_text': 'I flee to the woods that have always been my refuge. I need their solace today. I extend my bow and let the arrows fly as I down one, two, and then three wild turkeys. I remember my lost friends and family because it\\'s the only thing I can do. Today is a day of loss for me. That\\'s the way it has been for the past two years on this date and it\\'ll always be that way for me. Yes, Panem changed for the better and there will be no more Hunger Games. Celebrations and parades are held throughout the country on the anniversary but I will spend my day in the woods in my own personal observance. It is right that people should celebrate. The end of the Hunger Games were a cause for joy and I understand the need to remember each year, but I can\\'t partake in it. Not when I was a part of it and not when the Hunger Games meant so much personal loss. Cinna, Finnick, Mags, I could go on and on. I can\\'t celebrate after losing them. Prim and Rue are the hardest for me and I can\\'t stop the tears, but there were also the deaths of so many other innocent people. The innocents always die and the rest of us must endure and go on. As the sun starts to set I return to my house. There are no lights on inside but in the dimness I can see a cupcake sitting on my table. I recognize it immediately as one of Peeta\\'s hot cocoa cupcakes, a special treat he created himself and only makes for me, on special occasions. Despite the solemnity of the day, I feel pleasure and thankfulness course through my body. I\\'m not sure I could\\'ve gone on if I had lost him too. \"I missed you today,\" Peeta says as he steps out of a shadow and flips on a light. \"I\\'m sorry,\" I begin feebly but he interrupts me. \"I know, Katniss, I know.\" He takes my hand and squeezes it reassuringly. It\\'s the truth. Peeta does understand. In all honesty, he is the only one who can. He pulls out a chair at the table in front of the cupcake and I sit down to enjoy the treat. I peel back the foil but he stops me before I remove it. \"No, don\\'t pick it up. Just eat it from the top down.\" Peeta smiles at me as he stands beside me with a hand on my shoulder. I eye him curiously but I follow his instructions. I remove the marshmallows and eat each one individually. Then I move to the frosting which leaves my fingers sticky and I lick them self-consciously as I enjoy the sweetness and then wipe them on a napkin. Finally I reach the chocolate cake itself and eat it slowly. I don\\'t eat chocolate very often and I will have to thank him when I\\'m done. As I pick up the last bite I see a ring sitting at the bottom of the foil. It\\'s an engagement ring and I drop the cake with a gasp, all thoughts of food forgotten. Peeta gets down on one knee beside me. \"Katniss Everdeen, the past four years we\\'ve had each other\\'s back. It started in the Games and many of the dangers we lived through we only survived because we had one another. We know each other so well, in a way that nobody else can ever understand. I love you with my whole heart. I don\\'t just need you, I want to be with you, always.\" He picks up the ring and holds it out to me. \"You\\'ll be my wife. Real or not real?\" \"Real.\" I allow him to slip the ring on my finger and offer him my hand to pull him up. I see that Peeta has tears in his eyes and I can feel wetness in my own as I embrace the man I love. \"I want us to have a good memory on this day,\" Peeta whispers in my ear as we pull apart. I do not respond with words and instead bring my lips to his. I kiss him tenderly, my dandelion in the spring, my boy with the bread. Forever mine now. ',\n",

       "  'story_text': 'Howl had been quite glum ever since the Witch of the Waste’s curse began catching up with him. He spent most of his time out, and the little time he had left after that was spent in the bathroom taking his mind off things by trying out new beautifying potions. There was little joy in his life at all. But on those days where he was feeling especially perky, he made sure to visit the flower shop to test the effects of his potions on the customers, and to watch Sophie subsequently squirm. Today was one such day. ‘Would you stop fussing about with those rhododendrons, Howl! You’ll crush them at this rate!’ Sophie yelled from the shop counter as she opened the till for another day’s work. She knew exactly what he was doing, and all the fiddling in the world wouldn’t be able to hide it - the rhododendrons sat directly in front of the shop window, and Howl was sure to pose as heroically as possible for the ladies that walked past. ‘If you wanted someone to swoon over you why not just go look in a mirror!’ ‘You’re forgetting my dear,’ Howl spun round, giving the onlookers a good view of his rear end, ‘that the mirror doesn’t provide me with any income, as attractive of a prospect as that may seem.’ He was certainly proud of himself today - he had spent ages in the bathroom perfecting the hair shining serum which he had added to his black dye to give his hair a mysterious glow. His eyes looked greener than usual thanks to a mix of some particular herbs and spices that Sophie had found quite odious to smell the night before; and as usual, he donned the black suit he had worn to Mrs Pentsemmon’s funeral, which Sophie was sure had been charmed. ‘At least stop showing yourself off - half of the women you bring in don’t even want flowers, they just take up space.’ Sophie huffed. The dog-man was scuttling around her feet getting quite in the way at this point. ‘Make yourself useful and open the door.’ Howl happily obliged, treating the flower shop as his own personal catwalk as he strutted from the one end to the other. When he got to the door he stopped a little short and looked down at his chest, realising there were far too many buttons done up for his liking - he unbuttoned two, freeing a little of his chest which prompted several excited squeals from the row of girls lining up outside. Sophie rolled her eyes. ‘Morning ladies,’ he said in a sultry tone that was very unlike his normal voice, as he opened the shop. ‘Morning Mr Jenkins!’ A few of the girls giggled as they entered, the rest of them going pink with embarrassment. ‘I can’t bear to watch this!’ Sophie muttered to the dog-man. ‘Half of these girls don’t look like they have a purse on them!’ Howl sauntered up to the succulent section, where he leaned against the wall in a pose that highlighted his arms, though it did look a little uncomfortable. ‘Mr Jenkins, what’s this plant?’ One voice cooed out in an overly high pitched tone. ‘That’s an Echeveria. Quite beautiful - perfect for you.’ He replied, to which she let out a girlish giggle and picked up the plant.  ‘That’s an Aloe Vera, not an Echeveria!’ Sophie mumbled to the dog-man as the girl came up to pay. ‘Mr Jenkins!’ Another young lady chirped. ‘Which colour do you think goes better with my eyes?’ She placed two flowers, one blue and one red behind each ear and did her best to pout. ‘Oh my!’ Howl feigned shock. ‘It’s impossible for me to choose as you look so exquisite with both shades.’ He gave his best doe eyes - what a deceiving cad, Sophie thought as she bagged up the previous purchase. ‘Both it is!’ The lady gave a lustful sigh as she whisked off to the counter with a bunch of each. In truth, the red clashed with her hair colour and the blue washed her out, but Sophie’s method of selling would only have driven her away without a sale. A few more hours of girlish giggling and longing looks passed, so that by the afternoon the flower shop had almost doubled its profits from the whole of last week. ‘You really are a wicked wizard,’ Sophie said during a lull. ‘I can’t help it if women find me attractive,’ he lied. ‘Says the man walking around in a charmed suit!’ ‘I told you, I don’t remember what suit I’m wearing.’  ‘Ugh!’ Sophie huffed in anger and stomped to the front of the store, followed by the dog-man who was trotting behind her in angry solidarity. She wondered if she’d overreacted, especially considering how well the shop had done in sales that day, but Howl still needed to learn his lesson. ‘Right flowers,’ she whispered, leaning over the front display, ‘you are to make Howl look a fool next time he tries to flirt a customer into buying you.’ She paced around for a few moments before returning to the till for a sit down. ‘Have you huffed and puffed yourself out of energy now? My goodness woman, do you expect me to do all the work around here?’ Howl moaned before swiftly sashaying back around the shop. ‘Mr Jenkins, would you mind terribly giving me a hand?’ A woman dressed in finery sounded from the front. ‘Alas, someone who treats me with the respect I deserve!’ He called over to Sophie before attending to the lady. ‘I wondered what flowers looked most romantic to you? See I have my eye on a man and I want to display some flowers around my home for when I...’ she paused giving a sultry glance to the wizard, ‘bring him for a visit.’ ‘Well, I don’t think you need flowers to entice a man, but since you’re asking nicely how about th-‘ as he picked up the bunch of gold roses that Sophie had perfected the day before, a spurt of water suddenly struck him directly in the face - then another, then another, and so on. With every protest, more water came shooting out of the flower head until eventually the sultry woman had fled and Howl was left soaked through. Where there once had been girlish giggles there was now an uproarious wave of laughter sweeping through the shop, with all eyes on Howl, but not in their usual admiring sense. ‘Sophie!’ He shouted, creating puddles as he stomped to the counter. ‘Is this your idea of a punishment? Making me lose custom and my reputation?’ ‘Oh calm down, Howl, can’t you take a joke?’ Sophie said feeling proud of herself. But from the way he treaded angry puddles all the way out of the shop, then oozed green slime all over the living room floor, before wailing up a storm in his bedroom, it would seem not. ',\n",

It was Richard who volunteered to keep guard while she had her \"nap\". Hunter had given Richard a long, withering look that left him embarrassed and slightly cross. Even so, she nodded her agreement. Always, as Hunter\\'s consciousness drifted, her thoughts would turn to the women she\\'d known. It was the last grasp of the waking mind. These were the beings she wanted to dream of. At her call, they appeared. At first. But by the time she was fully asleep, they would be gone. They faded into the darkness and, this time, all that she was left with were three rheumy red eyes peering at her from behind steamy breath. Hunter tightened the fingers that held her spear. Every night her adversary came. The adversary varied. Tonight it was the lizard she had met beneath Tokyo. His long, black tentacles stretched forward, more like a yawn than an attack. He was taking his time. Hunter could read this creature\\'s mind. She could feel the signals running through the nerves in his tense, powerful body. He was the kind Hunter could understand. The girls. The women. They were different. They broke your heart, or you broke theirs, and neither of you understood why. There was another figure, who appeared to Hunter\\'s eyes as they became accustomed to the darkness. It was small. It stared. It made Hunter feel uncomfortable, but she stared back. Their eyes met in one natural movement - wide, white eye on wide, white eye. Hunter knew that she would not be looking into the eye of the beast when the blood burst from her skin. She would be looking into the eyes of that pale, elfin face. In her dream, that was how events unfurled. *** When Hunter woke, she was still standing. Richard Mayhew, however, was propped up against a wall, clearly asleep. The Lady Door was lying next to him, knees tucked up close to her chin and barely visible amid her own clothes. Hunter stood and watched her for the twenty seconds or so it took for her to fully wake. Then she returned to her job. ',\n",
