Motivation
This is a repository for my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Introduction to Data Science: Capstone Project: Tagging Engines.

I created this dataset to build an algorithm to tag pieces of fiction.

Necessary Libraries
Pandas
NumPy
BeautifulSoup
Time
OS
SQLAlchemy
SQLite3
WordCloud
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Pickle
NLTK
Sklearn (sci-kit learn)

Summary of Project Results:
I setup an ETL pipeline to transform AO3 fanfic into a labelled dataset because AO3 has an award-winning tag wrangling system, so out of all of the options it was the best one to get labelled data with the least amount of manual processing. I also setup a machine learning pipeline to create an initial algorithm based on the toy dataset I created. Currently precision is better in the algorithm, however higher recall and f-scores likely need more data with better labelling to train on.
